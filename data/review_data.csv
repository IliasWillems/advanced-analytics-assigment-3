136510134,1685730,"It's pretty good! If this was more expanded, it would definitely be more than awesome. The final boss was too short and simple IMO, wasn't challenging at all and that was the biggest turn down for me. But the story is pretty simple, and if the developer wants to make another Cynthia game, the story can easily be expanded, PLUS this game can be a good experience to do the next sequel even more better.\n\nOverall, 7/10. Amazing dev, knows what he's doing, quick to respond to bugs, and has put a lot of care into their first game.",1

136511145,1829810,"If puppet combo made this everyone would play it for 0.7 hours leave a positive review praising the graphics, sound design and story and saying it's better than any triple A title released in the last 20 years despite having $60 lowest common denominator bait like watch dogs legions with 12 hours on their account and they'd lose interest in this game and never touch the game again and not refund it but still say it's their GOTY and they also say things like OG prey is better than prey 2017 despite the fact they've played neither and watched 5 seconds of someone unlocking the melee weapon on the original and wonder why their friends are never interested in their opinions on games",1

136514533,2364250,A cool game in which you have to make your own supermarket. Of the pluses is the fact that money is accumulated even if you do not enter the game. I love clickers and this game is no exception. I recommend,1

136514584,2227150,"Pretty neat platformer, controls are tight. Jumps are easy to make, and a good variety in stages. I'm going to lead with letting you know this game is very short, but it is enjoyable its entire duration.\n\n I think a good thing to do after beating all the levels and collecting all the 40 (? it was an even number I arrived at and I stopped seeing anymore) green coins is to try to beat all the levels with sub-one minute times. The levels feel like they're specifically engineered for this time frame in mind and it forces you to play creatively. \n\nI want to see this expanded into a larger game. I think the mechanics are polished and the understanding of how to implement platforming gimmicks is there. The dev is obviously very skilled at what they do. I think I got more than 3 dollars of fun out of this. I think an expansion on the concept should provide a purpose to the in game timer, such as beating a dev time or maybe a standalone collectable like the crash bandicoot games.\n\nThis is a ringing endorsement but I am going to post the few observances I have with the game after this, as well as my level times. (played with a controller)\n\ngood\n+ All platforming is incredibly tight and telegraphed very well. \n+ The little overworld is very fun to navigate however small it is. There is one out of the way place that immediately opens a warp after getting it and you can actually skip a few intended platforming parts using the core mechanics.\n\nneutral\n= there is an acceleration you have with gliding, it feels like the opposite of what gliding would normally do. I consider this neutral because after you get used to it it feels very satisfying to move around, but there is a learning curve.\n= physics with any moving stage gimmicks can be odd at times. It's consistent and you can actually use little things like leverage from spinning platforms to push yourself upwards a bit for more air but it may not do what you expect at first.\n= In my opinion, I think the gold coins should be finite. It would give an easy third goal to the areas, and you can very easily afford everything even without the respawns. being able to grind it feels like I didn't earn it. I don't know how much I can criticize the economy in a 3d platformer though. \n\nbad (these are really really minor issues)\n- recovery from a dive seems inconsistent. Sometimes I can recover and other times I feel like I can't and go barreling off the edge. This feels intentional but I couldn't get a feel for what triggered specific reactions.\n- The camera snap during the sections where you're repeatedly hitting boosts is a little jarring. This only happens once or twice.\n- I would like a little page in the menu that tells you all the information from the levels you completed. this is small but would be important for a larger game. It would have made tracking my level times at the end slightly easier too.\n\n------ Level Times\n01 - 00:58:802\n02 - 00:51:566\n03 - 00:48:949\n04 - 00:51:485\n05 - 00:55:513\n06 - 00:54:914\n07 - 00:41:248\n08 - 00:41:320\n09 - 00:58:073\n10 - 00:48:492",1

136518027,2151770,"Fun action roguelike with unique art and interesting gameplay. It starts a bit slow, but gets a lot better once you grab a few perks.\n\nThe main gameplay is typical for the genre. You advance through randomly created floors, defeat enemies, gather coins to spend on better goods in shops, and open boxes with perks. Everything is lost upon death, with the exception of special keys and stat improvements.\n\nThe unique mechanic is the blue and yellow energy. Numerous things are connected to each energy, and you can change at will. Examples include opponents that can only be wounded with the appropriate energy and chests that open only with the matching color. \n\nAdditionally, some weapons and perks are energy-specific; they simply don\u2019t work if you have the opposite energy. Fortunately, most enemies are in neutral energy, so you won't have to continually switch during combat.\n\nThree keys are unique to each floor and are hidden in unique puzzle areas. These challenges disable your ability to switch between energies but give you doors that, after you pass through them, switch between the two colors. The goal is to push boxes and use doors to reach the final room with the key. \n\nYou keep these keys forever because they let you open unique chests that make subsequent runs a little bit simpler. But the most important is the puzzle room that gives you coins at the beginning of each run.\n\nThe reason you want to do that is that items are pricey. It's nearly impossible to purchase anything just by eliminating enemies that randomly drop a chest of coins once you finish clearing out a room. While your starting gun has unlimited ammo, the short range and fun factor just isn\u2019t there because you simply can\u2019t afford a better gun at the start. \n\nThe game's subject is time travel and experiments, therefore each \""floor\"" is set in a different time period. Most enemies show up in all the stages, but there are still enough distinct ones to keep the game interesting. Four floors might not see much, but there\u2019s enough content here to keep you busy for a while. A nice addition is a library that gets filled with all the weapons, enemies and perks you encounter.",1
136516748,1409300,"nice settings, nice writing",1
136516290,2353190,"Entertaining game to play with friends, it is very green, but it is normal being the alpha version, it will remain to be seen how it evolves over time.",1

136520287,2205260,"ENG: Icehelm usually makes difficult games and this one was no exception, the game is unforgiving, you fell from the tower or into the water and that's it, back to square one. Even so, it is addictive, with interesting mechanics and as you go up there is a lot of abilities to build your playstyle.\nIt's a Roguelike FPS inspired by Smash Bros, what more can you ask for?\n\nESP: Icehelm tiende a hacer juegos dif\u00edciles y esta no fue la excepci\u00f3n, el juego no perdona un error, te ca\u00edste de la torre o al agua y ya esta, a empezar de 0.

I do wish the ghosts photos maybe showed something once developed, that would be fun\n\nI would appreciate if there was better controller support as i like to sit back and chill while gaming since I play at my desk where i draw all day.",1
136523648,2283910,"At 80 cents a minute, I would recommend that you look somewhere else. The only interesting this is the inclusion of a full length movie inside the game. Everything else looks like a mish mash of Unity assets from the store with unmodified enemy bodies. The gun play isn't terrible but honestly, I have no idea who this game is for.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/4xAegjFvb3Y",0

136525640,2205260,"Very addictive arena brawler with roguelike elements. It's very enjoyable, simple to learn, and has that \""one more run\"" quality to it. While the mechanics are simple to understand, it is not an easy game. If you touch any water, including innocuous looking fountains on the stage, it's a death. I haven't been able to unlock any of the other characters yet. I do not believe this game features meta progression of any kind (at least not at first), so a fair warning. \n\nThe game can also be very RNG-reliant on a good run Yes, this game takes a lot of skill and being able to utilize the mechanics will get you far. However, there are a lot of things tied to RNG. One of the big ones are your abilities. Take the starting character: You have a shield parry, kick, and spear. The spear is, to me, far and away the most useful of the three. But since abilities are randomized every time you use one, you'll end up having to \""reroll\"" by wasting abilities a lot of the time to get what you need in a given situation. It doesn't help that I find the shield parry incredibly underwhelming and almost useless. I wish there was a mechanic where you can \""remove\"" abilities during the run. Distribution of XP can also be a little randomized. There are times I will leave the first floor at level 2, and times at level 3. I think if you kill enemies too early before they drop their loot, you can end up missing out on some (I'm unsure on that). Stages can also have breakables that have loot in it, which adds to the random nature of what level you are when you finish a floor. RNG also dictates whether or not you have a healing skull available to take away your pain percentage (your damage). \n\nThe stages have a set layout, but are randomized in terms of what floors you will come across them. It's entirely possible to come across two floors with the same layout back to back. There's also a bit of wonkiness with one hazard in particular: The fountain. The fountain usually situates itself in the middle of the arena and is a one hit kill to anyone (including you) who touches the water. Yet, I always have a hard time utilizing the hazard. Whenever you punch or kick an enemy into the fountain, they almost always stop just before they fall in. This causes you to waste another offensive ability, that is if you have the time and/or the opportunity to with the ability in hand. I kinda get it, but it seems counterintuitive when I can get flung/run into it no problem but the enemy typically gets a free stop gap before falling in. Also, it's inconsistent because there are rare times enemies can and will run/get knocked into the fountain without any issue and die.\n\nThe game runs pretty stable. The options aren't really fleshed out, just some basics. I only ran into two glitches, both of which happened the same time. First, I had an enemy stop fighting or moving. He stood there until I hit him again. The same enemy also ended up being kicked through a wooden panel set up on the wall, and he went through the wooden panel. These weren't game breaking and has only happened the once in my playtime both in the main game and the demo before release. \n\nI do wish there was more content. It's a cheap game, and a really fun one. But, many cheap action roguelikes, especially in the survivor-like camp, offer quite a bit of content with meta-progression at the same price. So far, beyond unlocking three other characters, I don't see much else in the way of content. The mechanics are solid, and I still recommend it for the price. It does need some RNG-tweaking and hopefully some content updates to really flesh out an otherwise solid game.",1
136523261,2205260,Fun game. Very tough but it was worth the entry price just to try an interesting and unusual game .,1

136526364,2355710,"My Worst Gaming Experience;\n\nThe gaming world has always been exciting, and the release of new games is an exciting event. Unfortunately, not all games are good enough to avoid disappointment. This was one of my worst gaming experiences, and here's why.\n\nThe game starts off with bad music choices. There's not only unpleasant music, but also a music selection that doesn't match the game's atmosphere. This is the first point that begins to affect the game's quality and atmosphere.\n\nThe game story was another disappointing factor. The game comes with bad art design and weak choices. Making it difficult to enjoy the game. This made it difficult for players to enjoy their game experiences.\n\nIn addition, the game's developers had many mistakes and issues. There were Turkish words in the English version. The game performance was poor, and there were many errors in the game. \n\nAs a result, this game was one of the worst games I've played. It had many problems, such as bad music, disappointing story, problematic controls, weak graphics, and developer errors. I do not recommend this game, and you can definitely spend your time with better options in the gaming world.\n\nYou can eat Subway or McDonalds for 3 dollars.",0
136525365,1409300,"To be honest, the story managed to make me really hooked at the beginning and managed to make me play this game until the end. NEO SURABAYA's beautiful visuals make me enjoy this game even more. \n\nWhat makes this game great is that they can apply a futuristic setting but still give us a closeness to the local culture. \nThe cyberpunk and futuristic atmosphere is well delivered through the visuals and music.\n\nIt's a shame that the story phase in this game feels rushed at the end, The action in this game also feels lacking, because when encountering an enemy it feels stiff and awkward.\n\nBut overall I recommend this game",1
135860742,1117160,"a frustrating experience,many bugs and bad UI,hard pass",0
132599383,1117160,"played a few games with it and all i can say is taht this is a VERY rough diamond of a game, it almost have elements of 4X as you go to war with other nations and grab lands and make alliances with other, trade is also very crucial to your nation as some resources are scarce in your region while sometime there are overabundance for it. for a free game.. this feels really good\n\nthe 2 main issue from this game from the hours i played is that first off, there is perfomance issue such as delayed notification meaning you have to refresh the game a few times and secondly is that the game doesn't run on real time, how it works is that the game update every 30 seconds however you can set how many years lapsed in those 30 seconds meaning moves took a full minute to get throught and stuff like that\n\nbut as a free game? yea i do recommend this as some sort of time waster or if you are bored",1

131059424,1117160,"It's a good game- But I don't understand why the developers put some options into the game that punish you for selecting them. Like, zero good- Purely penalties, with nothing that will be beneficial as an outcome of choosing it. At times it feels like it's the developer's ideology / views on things that you need to conform to, unless you're willing to be punished for it.\n\nAn example of this:\nAll of these options cost the exact same.\nHow is it Socially Acceptable to Discipline a Child?\nCalm Voice & Repetition (+1% Research Speed)\nRaised Voice - Emphasis (-2.5% Who Leads Options Cost)\nGrounding (Peasant Rebellion Yearly +0.1%, +976 Years as Common Souls, +4% Charge Dmg)\nA Slap on the Behind (+2% Melee, +0.1% Peasant Rebellion Yearly, costs less)\nBelt Slaps (Common & Noble Soul Length increase, Peasant Rebellion, Siege bonuses)\nWorse...  (So many penalties that I'm going to just say LOUD INCORRECT BUZZER NOISE)\n\nYou see what I mean? All of these except grounding cost the same, but some in particular are just flat out worse with no benefit. All I'm getting from this is that the developer was grounded as a child, and is still salty at his parents for it. Why even have the 'Worse...' Option? Why even have the belt slaps option? Why have the slap on the behind, or grounding option? They're all *clearly* the incorrect choice to what you're trying to show as a free choice question.\n\noh btw circumcisions result in peasant uprising",1

127519285,1117160,"Imagine playing an intricate time based empire builder and then making a review where you complain about how much time goes in, or how intricate the devs have created this masterpiece. Shame, just, shame. This is not a game where you just pound it out in one night or two.... to be clear this is a round based format scheduled around each month. Each \""sim\"" is around one month long and as such the game is formatted to fit that timescale. You log in, and then come back in another 8 hours. As for the amazing level of detail in this game, all I can say is that this game will actually change your life if you let it. The amount of unpacking you can do as a thought experiment for each and ever decision you make for your nation is unbelievable... and we are just in early development. Give this team another 2 years and the sky is the limit. On top of all of this you can even add your own decisions and format your stats to how you want to play. As a side benefit, if you enjoy worldbuilding (such as for writing or playing DnD / other roleplaying games) Mind of Nations will give you so many cool ideas to jump off of its truly an endless well.

136557136,1919720,"What's here is fun, although there is very little and it won't take long to max everything. The problem is the developers have scammed us. Let me explain.\n\nThe last game update of any kind was on March 8, 2023. https://steamcommunity.com/games/1919720/announcements/detail/3649643127858026732\n\nOn April 4th they announce they are leaving Early Access on April 11th. https://steamcommunity.com/games/1919720/announcements/detail/5878926928059763043\n\nOn April 11th, today, the game officially leaves Early Access. https://steamcommunity.com/games/1919720/announcements/detail/3699185258946204503\n\nThe problem is there has been no game update of any kind between March 8th and now, April 11th. I know because I bought the game in early April when I saw announcement of the full release, and it's been installed the whole time. And in that time there has been no update. Checking the game now there are no new characters or levels or content so I'm not mistaken. When I bought the game in anticipation of the full release, I expected a patch of some kind, even if it was just bug fixes. Instead they leave Early Access in name only. So if this wasn't a scam, if there wasn't additional content and fixes they intended to release, then why didn't they leave Early Access on March 8th? They knew this beforehand and revealed it on Discord but not Steam: https://imgur.com/a/8G5QOvY. I buy games on Steam, not discord. They should've told us here, in the April 4th announcement.\n\nIt appears the devs didn't want to work on the game more, knew it was in an acceptable and unbroken state, albeit incomplete, and so just left Early Access to get rid of that moniker.\n\nIf that doesn't bother you then I still can't recommend the game except on a good sale because there's very little content here. Only 5 characters, 3 maps, and a dozen weapons. There are no weapon evolutions, no interesting ways to play the game, and maxing the meta upgrades is fast and easy. You simply earn the resources and then max the stats on a weapon and you're done with it.\n\nAlso I just noticed that on the store page there is proof this is a scam, that the game is incomplete. You can see the character roster and there are silhouettes for 8 characters but we only got 5: https://imgur.com/a/qeM7nim. Also now that I think about it, there are more buildings on the main menu that I assumed would get unlocked at some point for more upgrades and features, but no they don't do anything. It's just the 3 buildings in the front and portal and that's it.\n\nDo not support scamming, lying devs. There are tons of other, better Survivor games.",0

Everything is buggy and janky, and its barely an early access game. For 15$, I cant complain too much. I miss when games didnt push early access on its playerbase to generate funds to continue developing, but that seems to be the norm nowadays. Its kept me entertained so far at least, but on a 3090ti system I would expect no lag on a relatively poor looking game.\n\nI was expecting a comparable experience to \""Gold Rush the Game\"" but that buggy as it is, is still better than this currently.

I'm sure purists of either genre would scoff at that) to nail to enjoy it, which is using a different reality to raise questions about and ponder our own. I liked the questions it raised and the pondering it did!",1
136559419,2156300,"I think a lot of the negative reviews are people expecting the same thing as the dev's previous game, but they've said from the very start this is something completely different.\nThe extent of the \""sexual content\"" in this game is roughly on par with what you would see on TV, this is a dating sim first and foremost.\n\nThe writing is actually pretty charming, and the character's personalities are some of the more realistic I've seen in a VN.\nThere isn't much to the story yet but it's a couple hours setting solid ground work for something potentially great, so you may want to wait for some updates if you'd rather a bigger chunk of story.\n\nThe only things I could complain about is:\n1) Some scenes just take your control away for no reason and you have to wait for it to click through for you.\n2) A lot of the normal VN controls are missing\n3) The sound needs some work, some scenes have the effects and music wildly unbalanced while others have no sound at all.",1

Reminded me a lot of college: some of the people I knew, the excessive wind up to try to impress someone, the screwy way life just takes over and how unpredictable romance can be.\nThe writing is excellent and the images are sharp, clear, often gorgeous.\nThey took a risk by leaving out lewd; it will cut their sales but I think it is more artistic in a way. The story leaves plenty of time for some later and by the time you get there you will care about the characters.\nI think its a refreshing addition to the genre; kind of Sleepless in Seattle instead of Debbie Does Dallas.",1

136561484,1118110,Only 7 hours in and have finished the tutorials and am now on my own. Great concept and am enjoying the game. Everything is maxed out and have not had any stutter or lag issues I have seen others report. Here is my take so far:\n\nPro:\n1- Game looks nice and runs smooth (for me).\n2. Good concept but could be lacking longevity or replayability.\n3. 3 different mines on the map and map is large although a lot of wasted space\n\nCons:\n1. A lot of the controls are not really explained clear enough- especially when it comes to assigning haulers to diggers. Make sure you assign the hauler first then the digger or you will waste a ton of resources.\n2. When it comes to the second and third mine- to load the cargo onto the barge or train- make sure you hit the Q and E key to open and close the scoops. Also was not clear.\n3- The drill rig was also very confusing at first- but the arms can rotate outwards much further than it appears. You just have to keep moving them in a circle format to fully extend them. Might be easier on controller but on keyboard it was a chore.\n 4. My biggest complaint and an issue I might be overlooking:\n\nWorkers do not seem to continue to work if you are not in the mines. At least it seems that way to me. So not much reason to have all 3 mines working. As there is no fast travel and it takes for ever to travel between mines- I think I am going to sell all the machines at the first mine and just concentrate on either the 2nd or 3rd mine. Someone could clarify if I am missing something here.\n\nAnyway- that is my 2 cents- thanks for taking the time to read it.,1

I would like to say though even Nicholas Sparks does steamy sex in his books/movies it did not hurt him but that is not what the development team is going for (you can portray Intimacy with nudity and not be pornographic, sex sells ). No 2. Price point in 2009 Minecraft was sold for 13 dollars ( you can google this ) so is Unscripted.. do not expect Minecraft level of play ability. No 3. I ran into Saving problems while I was save scumming all the possible options to get all the possible 4 vibes which i only did 3 romantic / dreamer / Joker. (fixed by turning off the game and turning it on again ) No. 4 I got some flashing white blank in the middle of the screen during some scenes. which only appeared a few times but still annoying. also Trying to keep track of the Vibe changes seems to have stopped after the Demo version of the game. also the relationship points for ( trust ) the River char. only seemed to show during the first episode. making everything you did before demo and after demo not integrated. i.e you will go on a date with River no matter how bad you fucked up. No. 5 Second girl ( i think the name was angela lol ) during the pitch meeting seems more filler at this point to express how shitty the MC's life really is and the whole important choice there really was not that important but to give you different ways you can react to rejection / opportunity. No. 6 At least the most of the Graphics as far as i can tell ( yes i breeze thru alot of AVN ) are not recycled or horribly out of human proportions. but  i think they can do better.. ( they could have made the mc character more pleasant looking maybe not like Tom Cruise or Zac Efron but just a little more leading man like also why does not he look like his bro. ? he adopted? ) No 7. (im trying to get to ten but should have stopped at 5.) The sound Still comes on when i turn on the game even when i muted it on a previous run thru it didnt remember my settings from past run? ( ya im nitpicking at this point i know ) No. 8. one of the other reviews Said not enough save slots i didnt believe till i started scumming to try to get all the possible Vibes so yes this is the truth on that matter. No. 9 ( almost there ) During the Sex Scene you asked if you want to skip it and manually control it some how that part still buggy because i clicked no to not skip and yes to control it and it skipped. ( ya i know its a bug? still buggy at launch? dont worry i played 7 days to die thru what felt like 10 years of early access and ya that shit i still play today still buggy as hell or id like to think of it as a feature ) No. 10 Finally with all the bad things i might have said i would still wait to see how it ends up i been waiting for VTM Bloodline 2 since what 2019? at least Unscripted actually is out.",0

And what can I say about pros and cons of this game.\n\nPros:\n+A lot of game modes, both PvP and PvE. Not all of them are equally populated but you can find a match even in not so popular modes pretty fast.\n+Over 60 characters to choose from. Different operators offer different playstyles, some are good for mowing down bots, some are perfect for PvP.\n+Nice visuals with decent system requirements.\n+No 'pay2win' - all operators can be purchased with ingame currency (and you don't need to grind for weeks to buy one you like).\n\nCons:\n-Visual customisation system are lacking. You can apply different camos to the operator but most ot it can be obtained only during events or for premium currency. Nearly all of the skins with really unique looks are premium.\n-Leveling up the operator can be tiresome - later levels require lots of XP and credits to grind.\n\nSummary: good 'heroic shooter' in realistic setting with lots of coop and competitive activities. It's good to see it on Steam at last.",1

136565224,307950,"(I have far more playtime through the standalone launcher prior to the Steam release.)\n\nFirst and foremost, allow me to say that Caliber hasn't always been the game that it is now. If you have ever heard anything negative about this game, chances are those things no longer exist. The developers have been very open and willing to listen to the community in order to make this game worthwhile. And with that said, Caliber is certainly a game worth playing.\n\nIf you've ever played Ghost Recon Phantoms or SOCOM, Caliber is basically the spiritual successor to these classic third person shooters. There are a ton of unique operators to pick from, team based gameplay in which each person fills in their own role, fun co-op missions, various game modes, and no P2W. If you're a fan of third person shooters, tactical shooters, or shooters in general, you absolutely should give Caliber a try.\n\nAs someone that has been playing games since the early 90s, I would like to thank the developers for not only listening to the community in order to improve this game, but for making such a game to begin with. Caliber offers up a nostalgic experience, harkening back to a time when shooters weren't mindless, and horribly generic. You've done good, 1C. Keep it up!",1

136564796,307950,"So far, so good",1
136565458,2094270,"Lightracer Spark is a visual novel set in a Sci-Fi world. It's pretty much a narrative game where your choices matter as you progress through story. There are also some strategy elements, such as building various buildings, collecting resources, implementing space stations modules etc. I have to say that this game really surprised me how well made it is. \n\nStory/Narrative:\n\nI have to say that story is quite well written and everything is connected with each other. There is a lot of text to read, a lot of choices to make. Currently you can only play Chapter 1 (new chapters will come as DLCs) that has many mini chapters in it, and as you progress the story, you're able to learn a lot about who you are, what is your mission and what you're capable of doing. Prologue is some sort of Tutorial that shows you and teaches you how to play the game. The other chapters are specific stories that tell you about certain events. Now, the biggest pat of this game is that as Amender (controller of planets and universes) you have specific traits that influence the story. You can pick between 5 different paths and each brings unique traits and bonuses. In the story there will be some choices that you can complete and they have difficulty, ranging from very easy to very difficult. They do somewhat influence the story as it makes you get different ending and you don't collect all the information needed but the higher traits you have, the easier it is to complete them. For example, you'll have to talk about history of certain civilization and to complete that choice, you'll need decent knowledge on \""Strange Worlds\"" that is a specific trait in the game. All in all, I have to stay that story is quite unique and it does get you hooked but I just wish that developers added the button that you can speed up the text since most of the time you yourself have to click Continue in order to progress through story and text is quite slow which leaves you enough time to read everything.\n\nStrategy elements:\n\nI personally think strategy elements don't influence the game that much. Yes, you have to collect resources such as energy points, technology points and population in order to complete some chapters, but at the same, you collect those quite fast and buildings are quite cheap to build. You can also upgrade them which allows you to gain resources faster. There are special buildings that do require some effort to build, and they bring you various bonuses and materials that are later required to build certain buildings. In general, it's not time consuming but you'll sometimes forget that they even exist or forget to upgrade them since you're mostly focused on the story. There is also war in this game. I personally think it's quite unfair for other provinces and countries to get attacked by you. Because you're technologically stronger and the higher population you have, the easier it is to recruit troops. Enemies are quite easy to kill and they won't pose a threat. I think it's more beneficial to just focus on your military rater than pure resources. \n\nIssues:\n\nEven though the story is quite well written, music and images are well made, I can't suggest this game for everyone. First of all, the mechanics of the game are quite easy to master and the game doesn't offer much content. Yes this is visual novel, but at the same time developers could have given us something more unique to do in between the stories and the stories progress way toooo fast. As soon as you're done with one mini chapter, you can instantly go to the other. As I already mentioned, building and waging war isn't anything special and it really doesn't bring you much. Time in the game can be slowed down or fastened up. If you have enough time to read through chapters and chapters of the story and you really do like to immerse yourself in futuristic world where AI helps you with everything, then surely this game is for you.  \n\nOverall score: 7.5",1

136566115,694990,"An old-school platformer with a lot of heart.\n\nThe game's controls are responsive, and the progression is well-paced. Throughout the levels, our goblin collects scattered coins which can be spent on upgrades, such as the beloved double-jump. Cleared levels can be replayed at any time, allowing him to access previously unreachable areas with his newfound abilities. For those seeking an extra challenge, the game can be completed without any upgrades, with an achievement as a reward. From time to time the goblin will encounter bosses, which, although easier compared to the levels themselves, are creative and add a nice variety to the gameplay.\n\nAn interesting aspect of the game is that all the sound effects are created using the developer's voice, which may initially feel unusual and take some time to get used to. Some players may find it awkward or irritating. However, it's worth noting that the game was made by one person, and this unique approach to sound effects adds to its overall \""hand-crafted\"" feel.\n\nIt's impossible to die completely in this game. When all continues are lost, the goblin is sent to the Underworld level with infinite attempts (after all, you can't die when you're already dead), and clearing it resurrects him with 15 extra continues. This process can be repeated indefinitely, ensuring that the player won't lose all of their progress and have to start over. However, the game can still provide a challenge, especially for those aiming to collect all the coins.\n\nOverall, this game is a great choice for satisfying old-school platforming cravings. It never gets boring thanks to unique and varied level designs, enjoyable boss fights, appealing pixel art, and just the right amount of difficulty to keep the player engaged. The only minor downside is that it runs at 30 fps due to engine limitations, but it doesn't detract from the overall experience. \nGive it a try \u2013 you might just enjoy it.\n\nDisclaimer: I worked on the Ukrainian translation for this game.",1

I never felt choices were forced on the player, and most (if not all) felt very much in character with the bios presented to the player. If you're a fan of visual novels this will be exactly what you're expecting, and if you're a fan of anything Tron this will definitely scratch the itch. It provides some new lore for the universe, and gives players the immersion into the universe that movies and traditional media cannot through the lack of agency.\n\nDefinitely recommend for a few hours more in the universe of Tron.",1

136569414,1772830,"TLDR: I highly recommend Rusted Moss.\n\n************************************\n\nI was one of the games playtesters and was fortunate to see the game grow over its development cycle. I have completed the game several times, and currently working through a play through of the release version. Even though my current hours on the release build are low, I am writing with the benefit of knowing what is coming from playing it first hand during tests.\n\nRusted Moss takes the standard metroidvania with double jumps and replaces it with a challenging but extremely satisfying grappling hook. Some people might find the grapple a challenge at first, but I found as I played more I was able to improve my skill quickly. And once you do.... wow this game really opens up. The satisfaction of landing a sick grappling sequence, or \""breaking\"" the game in ways that while intended, allow for a high level of creativity in how you approach the game. Once the game 'clicks', you feel like Spider-Man swinging around as he pleases. The game also has optional climb challenges for those who stray off the beaten path that push the limits of the grappling hook even further. The grapple challenges alone would have justified my purchase as they are extremely fun and allow you to attempt to improve your time, pushing you to be better and better. However, the grapple isn't the only element of the game, and to ignore the other elements would be a mistake as they are also excellent.\n\nThe gunplay is tight and satisfying, and playing with mouse and keyboard allows for precise aiming giving me a sense of complete control of my character. When I make a mistake I know it was an execution issue on my end, not a cheap trick from the game. Save points are abundant, which allows you to experiment and go for challenges that otherwise might have seemed too risky. Boss fights have always been the thing I look forward to the most in metroidvanias and Rusted Moss does not disappoint on this front.  I especially love when the grappling hook is integrated into the fight itself as it adds a new element that I have not experienced before this.\n\nThe story is an interesting take with morally ambiguous characters, fighting for their lives in a war between the Fae and Humans. With talk of prophecies, secrets, traitors, and double agents, I was fully invested into the story and wanted to progress to find out what would happen next. The music of the game adds to the atmosphere beautifully, immersing me further and further into the game. Going from making me feel transported into the world, to being hyped during a boss fight, or even scared and uneasy in an optional zone that become my instant favourite.\n\nIf you are a fan of the metroidvania genre, Rusted Moss is a fresh take with a lot of fun challenges and upgrades to explore. I highly recommend the game, especially to those who \u2018click\u2019 with the grappling hook as it opens up the world in a way that I found exciting.",1

It`s not only free-to-play game, but it`s free indeed, you can play and grind, all operators can be purchased for in-game credits which are gained through playing (except the newest operators from the last battle pass, which is fine, as they become available for credits). The game process is fun, so cool to gather with friends and spend some time here. But you have to learn the mecanics, study base principles and operators perks.

136571278,2156300,"EPISODE 1 is very small , many glitches are there. The story is fine but not much grabbing.",0
136569545,2156300,"I'll preface this by saying, it's still very early, and this is just one episode, but here are my impressions so far.\n1.  There are really no options.  You have one woman to impress and god forbid you choose wrong in one of the options you have, she'll friendzone you.  If you didn't find her attractive (and I really didn't--she was too heavy for my taste), then too bad.  She's the only choice in the game so far.\n2.  No roll back.  Did you hit one of the choices accidentally?  Too bad. Replay the entire thing, or create tons of saves as you go.\n3.  This next one goes towards the \""dating sim\"" aspect.  If the one woman pisses you off (which she did), there's no option to tell her to go **** herself and walk off.  You're forced to be nice.  I would really have liked a \""b*tch, I have enough friends\"" option.  I've never let a woman friendzone me IRL, and I certainly don't want to do it in a game.  There's great satisfaction in ghosting women like that.\n4.  I suppose because it was by the same people that did College Kings, I was expecting at least the chance to have some good, meaningless sex.  That was not to be the case.  I suppose this game is G rated, or PG at best.  My hope is that the more episodes that come out, the more this will change.  I can \""not have sex\"" with as many women as I want IRL. There's no need to go to a game to do it.\n5.  I both understand and enjoy the necessity to build up to a relationship.  It was my favorite part about games like BaD and College Kings, but both of those games gave you significant feedback when you did something that would cause a girl to friendzone you, or not like you, or whatever, and you weren't friendzoned... you were merely \""in progress\"" and the girls kind of let you know that.  In this episode, I got friendzoned and had no idea why.  None.\n\nAgain, however, this is all after just one episode.  Perhaps there's still hope and I do look forward to the upcoming episodes, but the lack of a rollback option is just AWFUL!  If you want to add an \""ironman\"" mode where you can't rollback, by all means, do so.  I generally do my first playthrough keeping as true to how I would personally answer as I can and some kind of ironman mode for that would be fine, but to force everyone to play that way every time is absurd.\n\nTLDR: As far as the final recommendation, I'm going to say for those seeking an AVN, this isn't it.  This is a teenage visual novel at best... no adult content whatsoever.  The dialogue is fun, even funny at points, but in it's current 1 episode state, I can't in good conscience, recommend it in its current state.  I will update the review as new episodes are released.",0
136571118,2216700,i never expected after defeating some bosses a number of times they actually evolve and they become tougher.\nlove the fact that its challenging and have to create new strategies on defeating them afterwards,1
136571418,1811990,"It's difficult, but not absurdly so - if you have played card based games in the past, you need to adapt to the unique counter twist this game puts on things. But the moment that clicks, it just becomes an incredibly fun puzzle to win the battles.\n\nThe runs are fairly short (an hour to two, depending on how long you think about turns), which is a real plus for me - I can play a single run and then hop and do something else for a while.\nThe progression unlocks different tribes (card sets) and some new cards, but the cards you have in the beginning are completely valid to win a run.\nCards can be upgraded in a run to focus on different builds.\nThe art style is amazing. The UI is great, it runs smooth and the music is incredibly cool.\n\nAnd if you're 1 coin short in the shop and click an item repeatedly, the shop keeper takes pity on you and sells it regardless. Whats not to love?\nGive it a try. It's a great game.",1

The journey takes us from colorful, vibrant landscapes, into medieval dungeons and murky swamps, which presents a welcome change of scenery and mood for each chapter.\n\nThe soundtrack is well done, each chapter has its own theme that fits the level and surrounding area, and the audio queues for being close to enemies or being spotted add some tension to the stealth gameplay.\n\nThe puzzles are well integrated into the levels, they're not too easy but also not very difficult, which makes it a chill experience while still offering a bit of a challenge. \n\nThe stealth segments of the game have a good pacing to them, the levels aren't just extended sneaking sections, but a healthy combination of stealth and exploration with some puzzles thrown into the mix for some variety in gameplay.\n\nI played with mouse and keyboard. The game is also compatible with controllers and joysticks. All controls can be remapped to your liking.\n\nThe game isn't very long. You can probably finish it in about 2 hours. I messed around a bit which lead to me spending close to 4 hours in the game. However, the game being short is definitely not a negative in this case. I think that overall the chill atmosphere and semi-challenging gameplay makes for a cozy experience on a rainy afternoon.\n\nThe game has some bugs in it, which is to be expected from a new release, especially one made by one developer and one 3D artist. Some of them have already been fixed in the [url=https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1685730/view/3719451786611878892] 1.0.1 hotfix [/url] that was released within a day of the launch.\nMost of those bugs are and were extremely minor nuisances but nothing really game breaking. Most could be fixed by simply reloading the latest checkpoint, which the game has a good amount of, so you don't really lose much progress.\n\nCynthia comes across various collectibles throughout her journey, which offers some replayability should you have missed some. The ability to select and replay levels after completing the story would be a welcome addition, since there is no way to go back to get a collectible you might have missed other than starting a new game, which deletes your previous save.\n\n\nWhat I didn't like as much was the dissonance between the character models. Cynthia, as the player character, has great quality model with physics and a neat selection of cool outfits to collect along her adventure. However, the other NPCs, while not looking too bad, are of noticeably lower quality than Cynthia. It makes sense to have the player be more refined than the NPCs we don't see as often and up-close too much, but it is still a bit jarring during cutscenes to go from Cynthia to an NPC.\n\nThe final boss fight was underwhelming and over before I knew it, I was hoping for a bit of a more elaborate final battle.\nIt sadly felt a bit rushed.\n\n\n[h1]TLDR:[/h1]\n\n[b]Pros:[/b]\n[list]\n    [*]Charming artstyle and aesthetics\n    [*]Lovely OST\n    [*]Decently challenging puzzles\n    [*]Well paced gameplay\n    [*]Very basic character customization\n    [*]Collectibles offer replayability\n    [*]Comfortable time killer that could be finished in one sitting\n[/list]\n\n[b]Cons:[/b]\n[list]\n    [*]Minor bugs (Some already fixed, others can still be addressed)\n    [*]Different qualities between character models\n    [*]Underwhelming final Boss\n[/list]\n\n\nOverall I rate this game a 7.5/10\nIt could have been more, but it lived up to my expectations. \nI definitely had fun with it and I look forward to what Catthia Games will cook up in the future.",1

I would tell everyone wait until there's a final product before spending that much money for this.  Yes, lots of promise -- but its only a promise.

I'm certain there's a specific genre description for this type of gameplay, where you're just a lil dude constantly assaulted by waves upon waves of thousands of enemies & the goal is to wipe them out as efficiently as you can, but it's fun and satisfying.\n\nThis one in particular seems to allow an absurd amount of customization in the way you link your weapons. It's really hard to explain in text and something that comes across better by just trying it out! Based on how you set up your links, your new upgrades can affect yourself, your enemies, your other weapons, or for example, your other weapons that proc off of hitting your other enemies, and so on and so forth (like an example - you can have a sword swinging from yourself, that inflicts poison on an enemy, that releases a nova burst every second, that inflicts a burn on enemies, which triggers something else to happen when it blows up, and so on).\n\nQuite a ton of fun for the low low price.

But I can given you a detail on what you'll get on this game.\n\n- Deck building game: Everything is card, Including you and you companions.\n- On your journey you can pick a cards  to assisting in your journey, So don't worry, You'll have a lot of cards.\n- Which also mean you have to building your own deck. The card consisted of Weapons, Companions and Equipments. Playing each card will subtracting a turn on both you and the enemies. Any card hit zero first get to hit first.\n- So its basically a game of wits where you'll have to manage the card you'll play before your team gets to hit  the enemies turn by turn. And trust me, Its not that easy at all. and you are going to losing alot.......This is where Rouge lite elements come into play.\n\n1. At the beginning of each match, You'll get to pick 1 out of 3 randomize heroes.  Each will have different hit point and Health point. Also some of them will come pack with the effect such as Barrage (Hit all enemies in the same row) etc. etc.\n\n2. You'l die. ALOT. Which if you are able to complete certain objective on each match. You'll progressively unlocking the building on your starting point. Allow for better equipment, companion and pets (And more)\n\nSo basically, This game is best because you can swooshing in and out for a quick rush and just leave when you thing just gone down hill and coming back later for better tryout. Its really fun especially when you just want to have something casual and still feeling serious at same time.\n\nOh yeah, And the art is cute as hell. Probably a reason why I bought this game.",1

136577806,307950,"PSA: Must play for SOCOM fans.\n\nI played about 150 hours in the standalone years ago. I decided that I should start playing again because now it's on Steam. They have done so many quality of life improvements that you new players can enjoy. The bullcrap system with the \""mobile game\"" like daily where you send your operators to collect stuff is gone. There used to be so many currencies you had to grind and now the only basic silver & fragments is enough with the premium currency. Grinding operators to get better before was insanely boring, tedious and annoying. Now it's simple and much better. Straight line and you just spend the free to play currency to activate new talents. \n\nGraphics are good and so are about 80% of the legendary operator skins. There are few goofed up stuff but rest are some old school gear and then some tactic00l af stuff. Pick the operator you like, read what their skills do and enjoy. Store updates weekly that which operators are on discount. \n\nTo all new players, please play the tutorial. I play medic 90% of the time so please, don't run away from me. If you need the heals, go to the medic or stay near the player and if the skill requires a chain or AoE don't leave it. Don't spend your syringes that much since medic can carry 6, save your one syringe when it all hits the fan. \n\nI never liked the PvP and never gonna play it. I just love to grind the simple PvE maps and modes. \n\nIt's not perfect though, the new voice acting in some maps that are totally redone with \""story\"" cutscenes etc. is so abysmal that you may want to mute your dialogs. It is just disgustingly bad. Some random voice actor doing stereotypically bad accents. Should have just stayed with the vanilla voices like in the old maps. There are also some really meta operators for PvE which are just hilariously OP and can carry the whole match. Bourbon is disgustingly OP as hell with Kit. \n\nIt is a good free to play game and it is improving more and more. Glad they improved so many quality of life aspects needed in the game, the previous currency grind made me quit but now I can just casually play again and progress.",1

136576275,307950,"As someone who played this game from close Beta all I can say is stay away.\nAfter playing this game for a long time, and having a peak in Super Test environment I can tell you, honestly that this team isn't competent  and they blatantly lie. For example this year was supposed to be without any new units, however, they need money again so they're adding two more. They increased the price of everything, just to milk people dry.\nTheir battlepasses were around 40 to 60 euros depending if you want to complete it fully, and the mod team would make fun of COD for having 10 dollar BPs that were cosmetic, while Caliber had literal pay to win collections for over 30 euros..\n\nI was once harrassed and DDOSED by the people i played against, provided literal video footage, however ScumbagJuJu who is the lead moderator, shut me up and never said anything to the russian players that literally attacked me verbally and my hardware.\nAnother instance was where i was unrighfully banned by a moderator, where he promised a certain channel, then acted dumb and demanded i prove it or he will mute me for a certain amount of time, when i did prove it with a screenshot i asked him does he need more proof or will he stop  eating shit, which he promptly muted. Of course he was scolded by ScmubagJuJu because he was in no right to do so, yet he did. \n\nThe player feedback isn't listen to, believe me, for four years we put up with their lack of balance and bullshit updates to avoid doing anything. They release a new unit, make it broken, literally pay to win, milk them for a few months and then somewhat nerf them.\n\nI've played every game mode, I have a decent amount of earned premium skins and all opeartors [besides the new pay to win americans and chinese] a lot of time spent in game as well. \nTheir rules are so bad, you can get banned, now let me repeat, you can loose your account, for Tbagging an enemy and or friendly. That was also one of the questions i was asked when they asked me for super testing \"" How would i feel if someone tbagged me\"" where i answered i'd find it funny, cuz it's all in good faith and gaming fun.\n\nWhoever defends 1C with [pre or after wargaming era] is basically just sucking up to the devs, hoping for something, or is  literally coping.

136576847,1527950,"I'm really on the fence about this game. When I got it as the very early and incomplete version, it was awesome, arguably the best \""tactical RPG\"" I know, even devoid of many features. But, as the versions progressed and the changes were made, it became worse. Today, probably hours away from release, it's... just another tRPG, I guess. With a couple interesting ideas and a number of annoying problems, just like most games.\n\nThe changes themselves are quite subtle. (sorry for long explanations, it's fairly intuitive when you actually play).\nAs an example, there is a very nice implementation of turn order: both your and your opponents' men are \""distributed evenly\"" in the turn order for the round, so if the number of combatants is equal, you and enemy take turns acting with a single fighter, until all fighters act. However, for the AI, the order of its units acting is fixed, while you can act with any of your guys (who didn't act in this turn yet). While \""unfair\"" towards the AI, it provides many interesting choices and tactics.\nNow, if the enemy has twice as many people as you do, for each of your actions, they make two. So, even if you kill (or otherwise deal with) the guy who acts next (the obvious choice), another enemy will act after that and probably you'll be in some trouble. So, the difference in numbers turns out to be very, very important.\nWhat did they change? Now, the number of your enemies is always quite close to yours, and in cases it somehow isn't, the extra units will arrive later (when you already killed many enemies) as reinforcements. So, the (rightfully dreaded) experience of being outnumbered is cut off from the game. Now, a lot of battles follow the same pattern: you neutralize the enemy who acts next, then he doesn't do much (or anything at all, if killed), rinse, repeat. A hundred of perfectly forgettable battles. \n\nI could write several such examples, including camp management, economy, fog mechanics. The early versions did convey the right experiences: you struggled to stay afloat with money, thoughtfully picked your contracts, took care of your men. But the updates made the game progressively worse. My best guess is, the game designers knew what they are doing and made bold (and really good!) decisions, but then some salespeople took over the game and made it \""accessible for wider audience\"" or something - just another game.\n\nUPD. The release actually happened while I was writing this. Congratulations! Despite all I wrote above, kudos for actually going all the way to the finished game, I know it's hard work.",0

133292009,1527950,"Really has potential. Really into the concept.\n\nThere's so much going on in this game that I keep dumping long hours into it. Yeah, it's definitely not a fast paced game that everyone is going to enjoy. Some of the fights I've run into more early on in the game have taken long periods of time both in setup/strategy and because of the turn-based nature of the game. It'll take a couple of tries to get things right starting out and it's pretty easy to lose companions if you're not paying attention to everything that's going on.\nMicromanaging your wages, food and companions' relationships is challenging and rewarding, making the overall hardcore feeling of the game much more appealing for players like me. Screw up positioning and lose your favorite archer, maybe save scum a few times to try finding a better starting position. There's a lot to soak up when you first start and there's definitely a bit of a learning curve, which makes it more entertaining and challenging.\n\nCannot wait to see where the game ends up going from here. Really enjoying what's there and I've only unlocked one other region so far, so there's plenty of stuff for me yet to do. I've tried a few groups so far and end up going back to the first one I created where I'm the furthest and in a definite money problem (though, I always forget to grab some prisoners - which is a pretty decent way to fund everything), sometimes a food issue, but my troop is getting stronger every time I sit down to rampantly play.",1

130199030,1527950,"Decent. Grab during a sale.\n\n\nThe fact that there is no initiative and any character can move when it's your turn (and vice versa for the enemy) feels silly. The starting positions in most fights also don't make a ton of sense to me. The talent trees are too shallow and it feels like some classes are much stronger than others. \n\nThe 'campaign'/story is nice, but the battles become repetitive fairly quickly. I stopped playing sometime during the third region and haven't felt like picking it up again. It's overpriced at $30, and I'd encourage nearly everyone to play Battle Brother instead, but it's worth a look if you can grab it during a sale.",1

130153060,1527950,Yes,1
130149997,1527950,"The basic premise of the game is that you control a changing party of mercenaries and seek your fortune in a low-fantasy open world. As this is essentially the same premise as Battle Brothers, which I'm very familiar with, I'm going to compare the two in my review. I think a lot of people who will be interested in this newer game (still EA) will have already tried Battle Brothers, so such a comparison may be helpful to them.\n\nCompared to BB, this game has a much greater sense of REALISM; every experience is more immersive. Instead of moving your party's icon across the map, you will see your group of members, complete with their beast(s) of burden and wagon(s), walking across the world itself. There are lots of points of interest in the world for you to interact with, including resource deposits to collect, groups of travelers of different factions, towns to visit, tombs to explore, etc. Most locations allow for you to search for things, sort of like a hidden object game. When you enter a town, there are multiple locations to visit, but they're a bit more involved than simply a menu with a list of options. Sometimes there are puzzles or quests involving multiple people, and in many cases you'll have to choose which faction to side with. Rather than hiring non-combat followers like BB, each of your companions can choose a profession which is very useful for the party as a whole; for example, you can designate someone to be a cook, which will enable them to cook recipes from food ingredients, and someone else to be a miner, allowing them to extract ore from mines. Most professions are associated with a mini-game; an angler has a little game in which you try to keep a fish on the line. The crafting system involves gathering resources from many sources: from town shops, from travelling merchants, from harvesting natural deposits, from skinning defeated animals; and then unlocking recipes that can be completed in your camp or in a dedicated workshop. The sheer number of things to do, and the way they all connect and benefit your team - it's a very impressive system. In terms of the fantasy element: if BB is a \""low\"" fantasy world, this seems to be a \""lower\"" fantasy world. If there is any sort of magic (beyond certain alchemy potions) or fantastic creatures (beyond a humongous rat) in this game, I have not discovered it yet.\n\nGRAPHICALLY, the game outshines BB in every way. All people have full 3D models; all movements, battle skills, etc. are fully animated, and they're done so very well. I'm not knocking Battle Brothers here at all; it simply focuses on gameplay and doesn't endeavor to do a whole lot graphically, and people who enjoy it aren't looking to be wowed with graphics. That said, this game does, and uses the graphics for full immersion in a very impressive way.\n\nThe COMBAT is comparable to Battle Brothers, each having strengths and weaknesses. One of my favorite things about both games is that everybody can die. For real. For good. If you suck and let one of your guys die, they're dead. Gone. Bye bye. When I said your party is *changing*, that's what I meant: if you bite off more than you can chew, they'll be pushing up daisies in no time, and you'll have to recruit replacements. That said, combat in this game is *slightly* more forgiving, in that there's a mechanic applied to all your characters that essentially gives them the \""nine-lives\"" perk from BB; that is, if they would be killed by a blow the first time, they survive it for a moment but will die for real if they take any more damage before they are healed. \""Healed\"", meaning a realistic first aid skill that doesn't magically put them back to full health - it stops bleeding, burning, etc., and gives them a few hitpoints. A major difference between this game and BB is that battles are affected very little by RNG rolls; it rarely determines whether attacks hit or miss. (It does affect the order that enemies take their turns, as well as damage output for most skills.) Another major difference is that the tactical maps are not hex-based; they are based on realistic distances. Characters, depending on their movement ability, may be able to move up to, say, 10 meters. Positioning is very important, as different skills and weapons have different ranges (in meters). There are also natural hazards for certain tactical maps, such as falling rocks in caves, or lightning strikes during storms. (I actually find that these detract from the realism a bit, however, for two reasons: #1 in real life, they don't happen often enough to be a real factor in any battle of this size; #2, you get a preview of the AoE for these hazards before the turn, so you know exactly where and when they will occur, and you have plenty of time to get your guys out of the way.) In all, the combat feels very good in this game. I'm delighted to tell you that I screwed the pooch about 20 times before I finally figured out how to keep my guys alive.\n\nYour COMPANIONS can be recruited from inns, from prisons, or other sources, such as solving a dilemma a certain way or completing a quest. You can also take prisoners and force them to do your bidding, including even taming most animals in the game and having them fight for you. Unlike BB, they have classes rather than backgrounds; the classes determine what options are available when they level up, so the customization doesn't feel quite as flexible as BB. You cannot equip any armor/weapon on any class. Only an Archer can use a bow, and he/she can't use anything else (that I'm aware of); in the event that they are forced into a melee attack, they can only use their fist to punch for a couple points' damage. The Ranger class is essentially a \""rogue\"" from most RPG-type games. They can only wield a knife and an option off-hand weapon. I'm not sure why he's called a \""ranger\"", as his primary weapon is not ranged and he doesn't really have any connection to nature or animals. As far as the uniqueness of characters' appearance, there are about 5 faces, 5 hairstyles, 5 beards, 5 hair colors, etc that you can choose from. So you can customize... just not a lot. However, companions can be either male or female, though I'm not sure of the full implications of this, or if it's simply an aesthetic choice. As you progress through the game, events can happen (like in BB) where characters acquire new traits or even promotions. When you hire someone, you don't know how exactly they will end up a month down the road.\n\nPROCEDURAL GENERATION: This is the main area where BB triumphs over Wartales, as it has a fully generated, randomized world for each game. This is the main reason why I have over 4000 hours in it: it's hugely replayable. In comparison, the world of Wartales and most things in it were manually designed. RNG does affect some things from game to game, such as which items are available for sale at different locations, where/when some resources will appear, who will be travelling where and when, the order that quests will appear, etc. However, the world is otherwise a map of the same area from game to game. You can re-play the game with different characters, strategies, skills, and whatnot, and you can unlock different starting areas as you progress through the game; however, you will still be playing the same world, and you'll know all locations, stories, main quests, and decisions ahead of time, provided that you've discovered them before in an earlier playthrough. In my opinion, this is the only real drawback to this game compared with BB; but for me, it's a major one.\n\nThat said, this is a very fun, high-quality game with a ton of stuff to see and do and try out. What the developers set out to do, they have achieved remarkably. And it's still only Early Access - you can bet it's only going to get better as they continue to add more of the same.",1
130143807,1527950,"this is a hidden Gem! very good so far. it is essentially a top down rpg, you do have a party but move all as one unit on the map with shared inventory so you dont have to swap between inventories of party members. the world is explored top down crpg like diablo or Wasteland and when combat is engaged it plays turn based akin to divinity with cool kill animations, and some environmental things. its got a pretty in depth crafting system and each character can have a profession they can skill up at and craft better stuff. there is also fun mini games like fishing and armor crafting and based on performance in mini game is the quality of item. it does have difficulty scaling so you can customize it to meet the level you find fun both on survival and combat elements.  party management does not feel like a chore as you find contracts to get paid to pay your merc party and can find food in wild/ hunting fishing gathering. also you can find crafting materials in world for crafting gear and cooking food. camping is fun and intuitive. all in all im having a blast and i wish i picked it up sooner. if you like the idea of a free roam top down crpg with crafting and good turn based combat that is simple yet fun this could be your new best friend. have not ran into any stability issues yet and only one small bug that was not a hindrance in any way.",1

126981315,1527950,Good game and different difficulties makes it enjoyable even if you are really bad/good at this kind of game.,1
126967397,1527950,"There seems to be a trend going on of games that are deemed good because they are difficult. It started with Dark Souls and everyone seems to be trying it. However the difficulty of DS is self scalable and a tone setter for the game. \nWare tales however is just difficult. Don't get me wrong, i enjoy a game that seriously stresses my mind. I wait with anticipation for Frostpunk 2. However when a game artificially makes its setting difficult for the sake of being difficult, no thanks...\nNumber of points.\n1 Game economics are terrible. You can tell the economic capability of a game like this based of the craft cost. A crafted item should generally be worth more than the base components that went into it. This can vary if there is a price change due to quantity in a market (not for Wartales). When i went over the general prices for many crafted items, about 1/3 to 1/2 are just straight out less cost effective than their base components. This is disheartening to see at the start of a game. I didn't even factor in the general cost of acquiring the items in terms of party upkeep. You can grind the game out and make progress with the system possibly. That was just a massive red flag for me right away.\n2 Combat is completely unbalanced. I know, people with tell me that it was fine for them, just use strategy, or if you do it this certain way than its just fine. A game like this should reward you for thinking tactically, not demand it. I don't enjoy spending an abundant amount of time strategizing on each tedious fight. Also if you are fighting same level enemies as you, the general expectation is that their capabilities will be the same. If the enemy can do double my damage at the same level and class, that's an artificial difficulty adjustment for the sake of being difficult. I don't enjoy it, and i don't enjoy being given paltry rewards for it. At least one wound at least per encounter for me, costing me at least 20 in craft good cost for a medicine, reward worth about 15 or 20. Just disappointing after the effort.\n3 The story is lost in the survival. Any semblance of story that you might come across gets lost in the desperation to simply survive. You will make decisions based on your current needs more than on your morals at the start. Maybe this is the tale they are trying to convey. That life looses meaning when you stop living and just survive. Well they are right and that, in the end, is why i didn't exactly enjoy this game. I play games to live, not simply survive.",0

126902464,1527950,"I really really like the game but most of the time you spend running back and forth, back and forth trying to get money or food to just feed your folks... I want to play to darn game but never really can because it is all about food and gold nothing else.  I understand that the gold/food is a core feature but dear lord dial it back a little bit.  I have all unlocks for gold reduction, food reduction, and repair reduction yet I ALWAYS run out of gold or food... I only have 4 companions and 2 beasts to try to keep the food consumption down but it is non-stop annoying that you are constantly running out of food, never have enough gold to buy anything from vendors really so only option is to steal and then you spend the time running from patrols.  As it sits only more hardcore players will ever play the game, dial it back slightly and you might get some additional players.",0

119492306,1527950,"This game is AMAZING. It's a Early Access game yet, but for anyone that enjoys slow paced mercenary group kind of game (yes, if you like Battle Brothers you'll probably love this) this is a GEM. \n\n60 hours into it and have only fully explored 2 of the 4 (5?) regions available until now, the other 2 are almost untouched, yes I'm taking my time to explore and grow my group but still, that's a lot of content and things to do in a EA game. I'll probably take another 60hours to finish all the content currently avaiable and wait anxiously for more. \n\nThe combat is very in-depth and even in Normal it's a welcome challenge, a lot of factors to take into account because each and every encounter is different, different mini-bosses, deployment and so on. Every single fight I have to think about what I'm doing, if I rush in head on even on lower level encounter I can get a guy killed. \n\nThere is a lot of skills and especializations in the game, each of them bring something new to the table and makes you adapt to each situation depending on the guys you have. Nice crafting system, altough the weapons and armours you can craft gets pretty old when you reach lvl 6 and start dropping higher level stuff. They are still very much useful nonetheless. \n\nThe only complain I have is the pathing system in the world map, you get stuck a lot but it's ok. I wasn't expecting to be so hooked up on the game since is EA, but the devs made an awesome game so far. It's well worth the price if you ask me, ESPECIALLY because the devs are apparently keeping up with the roadmap with almost no delays. I wholeheartedly recommend this game, in a era of awful and shallow AAA games as well as a flood of indie companies doing mini games to stay afloat, Wartales is gigantic breath of fresh air!\n\nYou like Battle Brothers?

Unfortunately, there are still several bugs that range from mildly annoying to game-breaking.  By far the worst (at least on my system) is the chance to crash the entire computer upon entering any town marketplace (happens about 25% of the time), which also often corrupts both the auto-save and manual saves from that game.  I have one campaign 15 hours in, but due to that crash and save corruption, I can no longer play it.

112776733,1527950,"Could be an interesting game. Combat is fun and interesting.\n\nBut it's too frustrating to play until they improve the save game system. You can only have one save game per run and auto-saves are not reliable since there's no telling when it's being done. The ability to have more than one save per play-through as well as auto-saves for beginning of last combat and last entrance to town would be nice.\n\nUninstalling and will wait a year to see how it improves.\n\nEdit: Reinstalled to try the different save game setting called \""Free\"" and is a lot more helpful than the default setting. Would be nice to have a Quick Save option with the \""Free save\"" option like many other games that gives the save game names by the relative position in the world or something.",1

109862139,1527950,"Developers that are listening to their players!!! Well I never :D\nHope that game will be finished soon, but even in an early access is a good one.\n",1
109836280,1527950,"Hm...  42hrs in my first playthru.  \n\n42hrs in the first area alone.  \nI felt like with the EA, I hit the limit with my team too quickly.  Got the hang of the whole, fight, run home, repair, eat, fight, run home, repair, eat, etc. fairly quickly.\n\nAs ambitious the concept of Wartales sounds like, I couldn't really feel emotionally attached to my team/character as I would in games like Kenshi, Mount & Blade, Crusader Kings, etc.  I didn't really feel attached to the mini-stories around the area as well.  I was excited to play the story of farmers wanting more with life but once I started playing, it felt like your backstory has nothing to do with how you play or how it dictates the world.  A game title like \""Wartales\"" feels like a \""Play the way you want to with the backstory you want\"" type game.  But this is just purely, fight, loot, repair, eat, sleep, repeat.\n\nOh, uhm.. once I figured out how to effectively and efficiently craft items for trade, it added an additional 10hrs of gameplay of renewed excitement realizing I could make more money by crafting from random loot and selling the crafted items. But then I hit my limit again once I managed to consistently stay over 1000 gold or so.\n\nAfter all that and completing the first area and moving to the second, I felt like I hit a wall to play this game as it felt it's a rinse and repeat regardless of the region you're in or the background of your team.\n\nOverall, this EA reminds me of other EAs I played where I play for a solid week or two and then hit a hard stop for many years as it just didn't feel wholesome or satisfying.  I guess I'll keep TRYING to play a bit more to see what else I can uncover..\n\nI don't really thumbs down games but would definitely give this game a \""MEH\"" for now.\nMaybe other users have a more fulfilling and exhilarating experience instead?\n\n\n",1

Instead of thinking they cant switch, OFC the ability to move your fighters around is obvious but personally i didnt know you could switch fighters at will at the start of combat AND during combat aslong as they havent spent their action. Until i had played the game for a little while. Personally i think there should be a more \"" DND \"" aspect to the game where the initiative during combat will be based on skill \""and/or dice\"" if you decide to implement that in the game.\n\nRunning on the world map should be a basic skill that you shouldnt have to spend points on in my opinion, because the fighters are grown ass men and women :P \n\nI also think that the cooking and the raw material production in camp should be increased to maybe 3 - 5 per rest, at least for a time when you start the game. \n\nSome paths in the game / on the world map, was pretty wierd to be honest :P\n\n SPOILERS AHEAD !!!! \n\nWhen you go on the mission to kill the colonel alex or (insert name). There should be a tutorial or atleast a hint that the player can plant a piton from their inventory manually. \n\nAlso the mission to go into the ancient tomb or crypt, I only found the path to the place because i saw some random NPC's running in a wierd way down the hill :P but the torch \""preperation hint\"" was good :) \n\nAll in all, thats my look at the game so far, i like it and i hope it has a bright future :) \n\n\n",1

107194722,1527950,"I buy a few new games this time of year, the sales, but this one deserves mention. It's stand out in many ways, it's a survival sim, as well as very immersive RPG. You are a band of deserters, bandits with the potential to become unwanted...or ??, or just some farm boys out for fun, that's just 3 of the 5 starting bands of 4. In the end you are mercs or bandits, or a trader, you can even be a cannibal with a pack of hogs you feed instead of regular folks. The game is very open, with lots of side quests, so much so that I don't want to spoil it as it's so new and so many are finding new ways to survive and explore. The devs also have a strong rep, and have produced some very good games, so looking forward to more content. Right now there are 3 provinces I have found,  trade is possible between them, but you will need to protect you goods. Another good money maker is bounty hunting, take prisoners and sell them, but there us a limit. The game is pretty well balanced and does not play like an EA at all, other than lacking voice actors it's pretty polished, the world is quite immersive with each province having it's own main story line....I think they all tie together, trade control seems to be a main motive? I have yet encounter any real bugs, though sometime I think i have, you can only sell bandits as prisoners...not the innocent folks you bash over the head and force into slavery because you are to cheap to buy another pony....but you will have to feed them. It's deep, and the turn based combat is too, like chess, skill and fore thought are required. in short BUY IT, best new game of the season. The only thing lacking is more provinces, and PvP, there is already an arena you can fight NPCs in so really hoping that becomes a PvP thing...with a full loot option of course, maybe even some Pvp provinces? Who knows? These devs have proven they can deliver what we want, the newest \""happiness patch\"" makes the games so much better right off, that was direct and quick response to player feed back.",1

Great squad mechanics and though the combat does feel grueling at some points its never 'annoyingly slow' (might b nice to have the option to skip enemy combat animations and/or allied ones). Trade system is good, the difficulty of enemies with leveling is nice as I've had companions die but it has been nowhere near a common occurence (on Normal difficulty). Quests are fun, storylines are exciting, I'm vaguely addicted to how fun this game has been and... -- I'm excited to see all this game can/will hold",1

105782346,1527950,"BLUF: too expensive for what is offering right now, Will come back to this review once there are enough updates to have mid and late game content.\n\nEDIT: Tutorial and tooltips have been added in the Comunity patch for December 2021. Once the autoleveling is addressed too, they will have my thumbsup\n\nIt's true. You currently have a lot of gameplay due the big map it already includes. You will really enjoy the early game once you have finished struggling figuring out how everything works, because it's not only there is no tutorial at all, it's that they have not even included tooltips or explanations for all the minigames involving crafting. \n\nAnd this is one of the cons I see in this game. It doesn't give you any feedback, you don't know any details about the character classes, which weapons they may use or what abilities will be unlocked when promoting one of your companions to captain or lieutenant. First times you promote someone it\u2019s a guess game adventure, like getting a new crafting recipe for a weapon (no, brutes can\u2019t use axes\u2026 seriously?).\n\nThe other big reason to not recommend Wartale right now there is no mid or late game content. You can only advance until level 5 and, after that, your companions will randomly get skill points whenever they get a nickname (it may occur several times for the same one and, guess what, the game doesn\u2019t explain why or when nicknames are earned or changed). The only thing that escalates the game is the autoleveling of all the enemies around, which is only useful to generate more of the same with the difference that you will get combats of half an hour or 1 hour instead of the aprox 15 minutes during the early game. Spending almost one hour fighting superboars over and over again in epic battles is not fun, it\u2019s repetitive and boring.\n\nNevertheless, there are around 10-15 hours of early game quite enjoyable and fun (learning process included). You should do the math if that\u2019s worth 35 \u20ac EA for you\u2026 But do it in advance, by the time you have learned the game and have passed the exciting first date and start facing reality (the repetition of endless battles), you will not be eligible for a steam refund anymore. \n",0

(So after 5h when you need that long)\nYES there is a premium you can buy for 10$ once. There are other boosts you can buy, that are for X hours. But development and server costs should be accounted for by something I would say.\n\nThe Discord is very active, a lot of helpfull people are there. The Discord is the main communication tool for the game and I suggest it for every player.\n\nOther from that? A fun game. It is basically Melvor Idle in MMO.

Bear in mind I'm a mmo and idle game addict so this does just kinda slot right into my niche but it's still fun and has a good future if the dev continues improving it.

It is by no means a bad game \u2013 its cyberpunk Indonesia is well-crafted and lovely to look at, and the retro visuals work surprisingly well with the setting\u2019s neon lights and vivid colors. The gameplay is mostly fine, too: some combat-related frustrations aside, I had fun playing detective, solving cool puzzles and sneaking around as I looked for answers and appreciated all the little details of the setting. However, what ultimately prevents me from giving this one a strong recommendation is the underdeveloped and clich\u00e9-ridden story, the generally poorly written dialogue and the inconclusive, unsatisfying ending that all hold the project back from reaching its full potential.\n\nFor more honest indie game reviews, check out our Curator page: https://store.steampowered.com/curator/6481290-GTOGG/",1

[b]no move limit or rating system[/b], just wreak havoc and move on. the enemy usually also has an arsenal and they're on the same 'timer' that can and should be used to your advantage, along with the game's self-admitted 'not necessarily realistic' physics. it's worth noting that enemy units only activate if there's something to shoot at (they're not bothered by your ballistas because triggering those would destroy their own things) and [b]your goal is to destroy enemy castles, but no problem if other stuff gets demolished too[/b]. maybe those tall towers with red flags are a third party and acceptable collateral damage.\n\nI figured with new additions introduced so often, most levels would feel like tutorials, but of course accumulated knowledge has to be used on later puzzles with more and more things, so it's not all a breeze, not for me anyway, and not that much filler either. [b]a puzzle skip option would be nice[/b], so if you get stuck, you're not stuck for good, though somebody's bound to make a guide at some point. level 17 caused the first real problem for me, had to sleep on it, and there were tricky situations later on as well, clever little thing. I gave up on level 30 for now, will try again if they fix the camera, look at this zoomed-in nonsense.\n\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2961080510\n\nI really like the presentation but [b]wouldn't mind weather toggles[/b] (clouds, falling snow). no on-screen level numbers ever is always a shame, here it's only on the level select screen. settings are okay and also available while playing, resolutions, windowed mode, languages, graphics quality, an all-important [b]screen shake toggle[/b], and only a single volume slider because [b]there is no music[/b]. surely kevin macleod, composer of all royalty-free music in the world, has some medieval stuff. unfortunately, [b]progress is stored in the registry[/b], which isn't covered by cloud support.\n\nit's [b]fun and satisfying, watching things fall apart[/b] (as long as it's not your own life), the [b]level editor with workshop support[/b] might provide longevity if the game gains popularity, and there's even a slight educational element, at least there was for me. catapult, trebuchet, same same, but not anymore. if controls and the camera got some love (it should be 100% mousable and non-qwerty-friendly), it'd be even better, until then it's [b]only recommended on sale[/b].",1

136585742,1118110,"Ok I really wanted to like this game and was looking forward to it.  I have well over the required minimum specs and it runs terrible on my pc.  Don't even get me started about the loading screens....I could literally drink an entire cup of coffee at my leisure.  I DO recommend this game after they have done a lot of work on it as it WILL be a great game at THAT time.  Right now I would hold off until they put some hours into fixing/improving it.   This game does have great potential.  I mean I played the demo and it was a blast although I did have a few issues, but it's like the release version went backwards.  Even though i'm rather disappointed, I will be keeping my eye on this one and would love to repurchase it later.",0
136588490,2109430,"Its worth your money and support to a wonderful studio. I loved the characters and the story, and wanted to play through this story to get every little detail and outcome.\n\n However, I could not get past the puzzle aspect and immediately wanted to skip it after the first play through. Not that it was hard, but rather that it became a game of connect the dots more than a puzzle card game. It became rather tedious and frustrating, and as the story got closer to the finish the puzzles got longer instead of harder.\n\n To tell the truth I never even learn how the puzzles worked until the very end of my second play though more out of curiosity then need.  It was faster to just connect the dots so to speak then try and figure out the puzzle.  \n\nThe music was top notch, and the story had me so involved I wished the puzzles were not in the game. overall worth it and I hope to give it another go in a couple days.",1
136586169,2109430,"I love this game. It's just a fantastic story/experience. It's great if you've seen the movies, but you really don't need to watch them to enjoy it. Definitely the best game I've played this year. One of a few games I would recommend to anyone.",1
136586063,2109430,"Such a fun game with an interesting story. Never played a visual novel type game till now and I know it won't be the last. I had a blast going after all sections of the game and getting all the achievements! Bithell Games, thank you for making this masterpiece of a Tron game.",1
136585876,2109430,"I'm a huge fan of Tron and I really couldn't believe my eyes when this new game was unveiled at D23 Expo right before my eyes. Fast forward to April 2023: I'm downloading, playing and soaking the game in. It does a phenomenal job capturing the atmosphere and vibe of The Grid. The story is captivating and the puzzles in between are a nice change. Oh and the visuals with the music... I could just stare at them for hours!\n\nIt is a little weird, to not have disc battles or lightcycle races in a Tron game - but this isn't what this game is trying to be. The description, screenshots and trailers make it pretty clear what it is and I think the price tag is pretty fair in that regard.\nAlso, they are working on more Tron projects and I am totally here for the ride! End of line.",1
136585702,2109430,"Pretty cool detective visual novel! \nThis is a game where your decisions matter, and where you always question whether you made the right choice or not. It's pretty short so you can do multiple playthroughs to see what happens if you choose differently.\nI'm not super familiar with the Tron universe, so some of the lore is lost on me, but I feel like it made it even better for me.  \nI didn't know who to trust or what to believe, or who was aligned with whom, but the game does a good job at explaining things and giving context, so I never felt lost or overwhelmed. \nThe writing is good, the visuals are great, the music gives a cool vibe.\nOverall, if you like visual novels, this is a safe purchase and a good experience. \n",1
136586055,1498040,Really good stuff here. Lots of unlocks but no meta progression otherwise. Although I prefer meta progression the style of unlocks here work well in place of it. This is one of the peaks of this style of game.  I highly recommend.,1

136587922,1469540,"Believe it or not, I've been waiting a long time for this game. I'm a huge fan of Team [Four Fats], and I enjoyed the mobile game <Maximus 1>, <Super Boys - The Big Fight> and <Black Moor 2> a lot.\n\nFirst of all, it's so good that this game was released on Steam itself, but it seems like it needs constant updates like someone else's opinion. Even if this game doesn't have a point store, I'd like to at least have an achievements or trading card. Also, the full screen didn't apply, so I felt awkward while playing... I agree with others.\n\nIn other words, I've been waiting for the release of this game for quite a long time, but I don't know the difference with the mobile version. I'm upset that I don't feel rewarded as much as I waited, but on the other hand, I'm a huge fan of Team [Four Fats], so I'll continue to play happily.

136588123,307950,"Surprisingly not bad for a F2P game.\nThe gunplay is a bit weak, but I haven't seen any outright P2W yet which is commendable. \nIt really reminds me of that old Tom Clancy online TPS, Tom Clancy's Ghost Recon Online, I am not sure if it's as good as that one but I don't think that one had PvE.\n\nOh and did I mention PvE? Yeah, you can play short missions against bots, they are not as good as Insurgency, but again, not bad for a free game.\nAs far as MTX go you can buy operators, skins (skins give bonus exp) and a premium sub that gives more exp/credits.\nHigher level characters seem to be a bit better, but I haven't played enough to know how good/bad the balance is. \n\nSo for now I'd say give it a go, I've seen worse multiplayer offerings than this, though I am not sure how long will the gunplay hold your interest.",1

It's a very competent turn based strategy and managing your party is simple, but still provides a good challenge when it comes to weighing up who gets healed, who's armour are you going to fix, will you devote some of your precious resources to crafting certain items etc. I had a lot of fun, I put just short of 30 hours in pre-1.0 and I'm sure I'll put in a lot more now it's fully released",1
136587902,1527950,"Game is good, and fun.\n\nIt doesn't have a central \""plot\"" or goal aside from \""Get strong and rich\"" and is very open ended, but also can get quite repetitive (I absolutely do not recommend Region-Locked mode as fights can get as long as 40 minutes with how many units there can get).\n\nIt doesn't have the strategic depth of something like Mount & Blade Warband or mechanical depth of Battle Brothers, but it's a decent in-between.",1

136591993,1949030,"The Sherlock Holmes games excels at immersing the player in the moody atmosphere of the victorian era. And this game is no exception - the environments in this game are downright breathtaking, and the atmospheric soundtrack does wonders in helping you get immersed in the narrative. The graphics are nothing to run home about with some visual glitches here and there and some weird looking models, but they look good enough to never take me out of this experience.\n\nThis game is a remake of The Awakened that came out in 2007, one of my favorite games in the Sherlock Holmes series, and Frogwares has done a pretty good job at transporting the classic into the modern era. The story, the characters, the locations and clue hunting gameplay are all here. Unfortunately, puzzles were mostly cut out of this one, which made the game a lot easier than the original and somewhat less fun as a result. A lot of the mechanics in the game are based around trial and error and less about finding the precise answer. \n\nMost people might not even feel the absent of puzzles in the game, but as someone who loves puzzles in their games and how they possessed a physical roadblock you must overcome, I was very disappointed by their absent. The new \""Insanity\"" puzzles are very easy and there are only 2 of them in the whole game.\n\nOverall, this game is good.

136591931,1811990,"This game is very enjoyable for those who love very difficult games and card builders.\nThe art style is superb and wholesome, got me immersed quickly. \nThe different card synergies you build can be very powerful if played right, however you will still get clapped regardless. \nI've only put about 2.5 hours into the game as of this review, however, I am going to be putting a lot more because despite the many times I've failed it still feels somewhat rewarding. \nIgnore the negative reviews, they were written by people who can't handle some Ass whopping. \n\nI rarely ever write reviews but seeing the mixed reviews made me want to give this game a thumbs up because it deserves it.\n\n",1
136591886,1811990,"I will update this review every once in a while\n\n3 hours in (Positive review):\nA charming and beautifully crafted world, oozing with love. Wildfrost ain't your typical deck building game. Cards will stay in play (much like Yu-Gi-Oh) for the most part and attack once a counter has reached zero. Their positon can also affect other cards on the board. There's \""spells\"" to cast, traps to lay, enemies to slow, debuffs to add and buffs to give. This grants a lot of viable strategies, which I really like.\n\nSadly though, the amount of new cards you get during a run is incredibly low (about 10 cards per run, if you get pretty far) and there's barely any way to remove them. Since you don't get to choose your starting cards as well, RNG will determine most of your deck (RNGesus giveth and he taketh). This is quite sad since there would be tons of combos, if only I could get more chances to aquire cards.\n\nThe fights seem to be more like puzzles. If you attack the wrong enemy at the wrong time things can spiral out of control quickly with almost no way to counter it. This makes every play crucial to the run. Combined with the fact that your character is also a card (which is always on the field)  this makes for very interesting bouts. You need to keep your characters HP above zero while also keeping enemy combos in check. This requires a LOT of thought and focus, which I haven't seen in other card games.\n\nPros:\n+ charming graphics, cards and music\n+ unique combat system\n+ actually challenging\n+ lots of stuff to unlock\n\nCons:\n- deck building aspect is not adressed enough\n- repeating fights with almost no variation (Note: managed to reach the final (?) boss once)\n- difficulty ramps up way too soon\n- game balance\n\nThings I'd like to see added/changed:\n- more chances to add cards/remove them during a run\n- more variations in terms of, for example, enemy placement",1

It brings so many new things to the table that other deckbuilders don't have, and It is worth playing and paying attention to. I see people complaining about the balance of the game, but a lot of the complaints seem to stem from a lack of understanding of the mechanics. The game is so good, and you should play it now!",1
136591700,1811990,"Highly recommend. Finally a game that elevates rogue-like deck-builders to the next level. Mechanics feel fresh, the art, music, sound, animations are all gorgeous. There's so much depth at every turn.\n\nSlay the Spire broke new ground for the genre by adding tons of variety and making battles more \""solveable\"" instead of being so reliant on RNG. Wildfrost gives even more freedom and flexibilty while building upon and adding twists to many of the common tropes of the genre. There are a lot of layers here with which to make significant choices in during gameplay, but it all feels cohesive and manageable.\n\nAlso there's unlockables (like Slay the Spire, but far more) but not meta progession (like Hades). This creates a much more satisfying experience over time as you improve your skills and learn the systems and enemies.\n\n",1

The game is slick, responsive, and feels great to play. You can tell the game has been built with a lot of care, attention, and passion by the small team involved.\n\nIn short,  I am normally not a fan of this type of game but I can wholeheartedly recommend it to anybody who likes what they see on the store page.\n\nThe game rewards time investment and skill development as you explore and gradually learn to use the tools available to you in more complex and daring ways. The game's difficulty increases gradually and never feels outright unfair. New mechanics, terrain types, and features are introduced gradually in intuitive ways before these gameplay mechanics are slowly iterated upon to make complex and rewarding platforming/grappling puzzles. Combat feels responsive and the game's many bosses are clever in their design and satisfying to beat.\n\nThe game world is atmospheric. The art style and audio choices work together with the character conversations and (sometimes hidden) lore drops to paint a picture of a world where human and fey collide.\n\nI think the best thing I can say about Rusted Moss is how it kept making me pause and think to myself \""[i]oooooh, that's clever[/i]\"" over and over again.

136592684,2354600,"You know the bullet heaven genre is blowing up when we start getting movie tie-ins in it. I yet have to watch Nic Cage's comedy horror Renfield due to the fact it's not out until May here, so I can't really comment on how accurate or full of references this game is, but I can attest to its qualities - and there's plenty to commend. First off, it's one of the best looking 2D titles in the genre so far: good looking pixel art characters and locations, spruced up by fantastic particle effects, tons of blood and even great fonts, with damage numbers, XP and such glowing up the field in spectacular fashion. Mowing down tons of enemies in bloody explosions with increasingly fun weapons, including bats and other spooky elements, is just a lot of fun, and at its core it's already one of the most satisfying, enjoyable and fun bullet heaven titles out there - and the game's stage-based progression and 3 levels already offer a good enough amount of content for several hours of fun. \n\nI already feel like recommending this Early Access title based on these premises, but on launch day there's various important things to work on. First off, the amount of awesome particles is great and all, but they can't be tuned whatsoever, and pretty often they straight-up hide enemies or enemy bullets. Said bullets, in particular, are very easy to miss due to how chaotic the game can become, and the game doesn't seem to have much of an invulnerability window after a hit - a lethal combo with the low health that impacts the difficulty. And the difficulty itself certainly needs a tweak: the stages are tough as is, with the bosses requiring a glorious effort to take down - and there's even a strict time limit after which the player keeps getting damage continously! Almost forgot to mention the fact the game has a weird bug where you can't close it properly without forcing it, but I assume this will be fixed pronto.\n\nBut it's much easier to fix a fun yet unbalanced game than a balanced yet boring one and, as said, Renfield: Bring Your Own Blood is a bloody, particle-heavy, adrenaline rush of a bullet heaven dance that fans of the genre (or the movie, I guess) really should not miss. It needs improvements, but I'm confident in the game's future and will certainly play much more in the upcoming weeks/months.\n\nBullet Heaven Fandom review #61.

136611352,1772830,"This game is a pretty good, casual Metroidvania game, and for that alone it's pretty good. However, what really draws me into this game is the fact that it has some of the most nuance to movement that's also extremely easy to grasp/learn. Slingshotting with the grapple and bunny hopping through rooms isn't as hard as other games, but it's extremely satisfying to pull off. This game is going to have so many cool skips/movement tech, which to me is what elevates a Metroidvania from \""good\"" to \""great.\""",1
136610454,1772830,"This game is great, but it is also relatively demanding. There is 'a lot' going on with the mechanics of the grapple that you have to come to terms with, and it can sometimes be unclear if you need to unlock a new ability to continue or if you just need to get better at manipulating the grappling hook. Definitely worth it's asking price. There is an Assisted mode for people struggling to get the movement down as well.",1

136611508,1811990,"3 different factions, each with a few different archetypes makes this a very replayable deckbhilder.

Very fun, the art style is very charming.",1
136611095,1811990,"Fun, challenging, and requires you to think ahead. You don't necessarily know exactly what you're going to encounter, but for the most part the enemies are very similar in each zone, and y. The art is cute and the musical composition is great (although several hours of hearing the same music will get old.) I do also appreciate how the mechanics are well-explained (if you right-click on cards) and enemy actions are always (with the one exception of [spoiler]Aimless[/spoiler] as well as [spoiler]enemies who explicitly have \""apply X to random enemy\"" modifiers[/spoiler]) predictable. Same goes for your own turns.\n\nThe comments about balancing are somewhat unreasonable - this game hasn't been out even a day, much less had time for people to develop proper strategies for this. I had some exposure to the game from watching a streamer play it prior to launch, and you definitely can develop a strategy to go forward, even if it's not 100% successful. Yes, it's hard, and you die a lot, and there's RNG (like any roguelike), but it is one of those games that requires time spent to unlock more and get used to the mechanics to make your runs more successful. The RNG is primarily constrained to what cards/charms you get, as with most any deckbuilder.\n\nTo the devs: there [i]may[/i] be opportunities to change the balancing in the future, but please wait a bit and see what community forms around this game first before completely nerfing it.\n\nAnyway, I didn't consider myself a fan of this genre, but this game's charm drew me in and the slowly expanding mechanics makes it very replayable.",1

136611627,1527950,"Overall this is a fun game.  I always enjoyed RPG like settings with larger groups, and this game certainly lets you do that.  It's not overly heavy on the RPG side though, pretty thin for story and dialogue, but it's forte is turn based combat.  \n\nPROs\n- Great map interaction, full of little Easter eggs to find\n- Fun game-like interactions with picking locks, solving puzzles, using skills, finding hidden objects by searching the screen with cursor etc...\n- Large groups!\n- Can recruit animals\n\nCONs\n- Hard to get going in the early levels, as your small party takes a beating and needs repairs and healing often; gets easier with more members as the overall damage gets spread out between everyone\n- Combat gets tedious toward the end, and gets very lopsided with your band gets larger\n- Each map zone has a different back story quest to solve, but over all they're identical in nature.  Main quest, side missions from tavern contacts, and random missions to stumble upon.\n- Traveling the map is a chore with the length of day and having to rest... seems like you can't travel more than a minute before you have to rest again.  Really needs to be addressed as it's a big detractor from just trying to get around the map and enjoy the game\n- Very simple combat system... armor is extra hp, and all damage types translate to hp damage.  There's no chance of missing/dodging an attack during melee, so you area always getting hit every time.  Each side trades turns until one side eventually has more people left\n- Tedious having to constantly pay and feed your party, but camp site structures help reduce that headache\n- Not a big mix of enemies\n- You can buy pack \""ponies\"" for hauling more gear, but can't ride horses to make traveling faster?!\n- lack of in game quest guide tips, had to use youtube videos at times to figure out what was going on in some quests\n\nI played this game on the fixed level option, so each zone had a set level range.  The starter zone was challenging to get going.  The second zone was fair, but after completing it I out leveled the third zone to the SW and quickly ran through that quest and all missions in a single round of combat every time (think I was lvl 5-6 and the enemy was level 3 or so.  By the time I got the the last zone in the east, I had already started to collect bears for fun, and ended up with 12 or so bears as they're more common on the harder zones (had wolves too but let them go as the bears racked up), and 14 other guys.  It ended up silly as the bears are absolute tanks with 1000+ hp, and can hit for 70+ damage and take up a lot of map space squares to provide nice meat shields for the rest of my party.  I could have just dumped all my human members except for a couple and a beast master, and just played the bears.  The good thing with having animals is you only need to feed them, not pay them, and you don't have to fully feed your group as the other camp bonuses make up for losing happiness due to lack of food.",1

I didn't find it to be too difficult; in fact, on my first blind play-through, I reached what was probably the final boss.  I lost to him because I didn't understand his mechanics, but I think I understand them now and that defeating him should be quite doable.  I think I could have won on my 2nd play-through, but I was playing at 2 AM and due to tiredness left my leader in front of the boss's 50 damage attack when I had plenty of ways to prevent that from happening.  I think I definitely would have won otherwise.  Either way, not bad for a 2nd play-through.  \n\nAll that is to say, I don't think this game is too hard at all, and I think it has a lot of interesting synergies that I am eager to explore.  If you have ever gotten an Ascension 20 heart kill in Slay the Spire, then ignore all of the negative reviews complaining about difficulty and balance.  The same can be said if you've ever gotten a max covenant win in Monster Train.  \n\nThis game has pleasant art and sound design.  The way you play cards in rows is somewhat reminiscent of Monster Train, but there are other aspects which make the game play feel quite unique, like only playing 1 card per turn (mostly, unless you have a specific buff on a card).  \n\nI'm glad I bought the game.  I have played enough Slay the Spire (about 500 hours) and Monster Train (about 200 hours) that I have been burnt out on both of them several times.  This game scratches the itch for a rogue like deck builder and is unique enough to feel fresh and exciting for me.",1
136613203,1811990,"gosh dang the art in this game is so cute, and it's a super fun game. So all in all, 10/10",1
136612926,1811990,"Game is an absolute blast so far, feels like there is definitely a learning curve to it that, clearly a lot of other people have an issue with. \n\nBeing someone who has loved card games for a long time and jammed quite a bit of Slay the Spire, Across the Obelisk, and other similar games including the Path of Champions mode in Legends of Runeterra, this felt right up my alley. \n\nGranted I've only got 2.5 hours at the time of writing, but with one win, a couple neat things unlocked, and a lot more to explore ahead of me? I can't recommend this enough. The music is stellar, the design is very cool, and they have a lot of cool synergies and interactions built into the game that get me excited to launch another run.\n\nGame is great, give it a shot, refund if you REALLY don't like it but it definitely deserves a try.",1
136612776,1811990,"I really enjoyed the demo, and really wanted to like this game, but I don't. It's not like the game is \""too hard\"" as others have claimed the negative reviews are about, it's just nothing like any other deckbuilder i've ever played. In a bad way. I hope they can fix it somehow, cause it's really cute and I waited months for it to finally be released. :(",0
136612753,1811990,This is even more addicting than Slay the Spire...,1
136612654,1811990,"I had the feeling after blacking out and playing non-stop for the whole day of release that Wildfrost would instantly become recognized as a staple for deckbuilding strategy games, because it absolutely is one, and I am extremely disappointed to see so many people levy vague and shallow complaints about balance and difficulty before showing its quirks any patience.\n\nNo, the game isn't impossible or unbalanced, but its challenges have sharp teeth that require you to navigate its encounters carefully, sometimes very precisely, to make it through each run. The game's combat is a strategy game with a lot of depth; you have to hide your hero safely, shuffle your positioning constantly to divide incoming damage, and use every tool in your arsenal to solve problems by delaying or defeating especially vicious enemies. The ways out of bad situations aren't obvious, but they are there, and the more you grow accustomed to the game's strict sequencing, the easier and more exciting they become to see.\n\nThat aside, this is an extremely fun game, and much more approachable than its initial reception would make it seem. A roguelite deckbuilder where deploying creatures and managing tough board states (comparable to Monster Train) makes up the bulk of its gameplay, with a really smooth pacing of single encounters against multiple waves and a boss chopped up by several upgrade/modification/event/shop/removal nodes in a row. You get a ton of back-to-back upgrade options for your loadout, which are extremely customizable as upgrades are handled by finding Charms that add keywords, stat modifications, etc. to applicable cards you have, with each card being able to hold up to three--by the end of each run, you could have ended up playing many cards you've seen before, but ended up with totally different versions of them, playing around different aspects of each card based on what upgrades you found. I really love how this was done!\n\nIt takes a very delicate hand to make a game that constantly gives you a feeling that you're not going to make it through this encounter, but as you play to your outs, you'll be surprised by the fact that you can, and it'll always be on the back of many different cards and mechanics working together exactly as well as they need to. The enemy designs are tight and varied, with bosses asking very different things of you to make sure you have tools to handle many different challenges, and there's a twist on the final boss design that gives you a very clear warning about what you need to be able to handle by the end of the run.\n\nFinally, I'm not sure what more I could add to what's already been said for the game's style. It's to die for. There's so much joy, energy, and personality in every single inch of the game. I've finally put the game down to sleep and I'm still hearing that catchy battle theme. \n\nIf you like deckbuilders, card games, roguelites--the whole genre, definitely give this game a try. And if you did, and you find yourself struggling and frustrated with it, I would encourage you to give it a little more patience. The game requires different approaches to its challenges than its neighbors, but if you really pay attention to all the tools at your disposal, you'll find a deeply rewarding game here.\n\nAlso, it really bothers me to see people some blaming difficulty on luck. The game has very little combat RNG. You see your whole deck in 2-3 hand cycles; I've had a run where after enough removals I drew my entire deck on every redraw. There are a lot of upgrades that might seem underwhelming at first, but have really clear use-cases in practice. The rules for targeting are clear, and even Aimless can be reasonably manipulated, especially incoming attacks. I feel that I have to address criticisms like this just because I don't want others to miss this gem of a game because of negative first-reactions that fundamentally misunderstand it.",1
136612639,1811990,"I've played a lot of card games. A lot of deck builders. When they mention difficult in the tags, they mean difficult. The cutesy art and card styles don't match the strategy and difficulty behind the game. This game isn't for anyone. I quickly realized I wasn't the target audience, even though I have plenty of other games in the genre that I enjoy. It's a shame because I really enjoy Chucklefish games. There is only one real difficulty and that difficulty is not forgiving. If you like a challenge that sometimes seems unfair, this game is for you.\n\nThis review is also after watching streamers play the game and wanting to give it a try, but it was just too intense by comparison.",0
136612593,1811990,"8.3 hours in and I have to say this game has a lot of potential. Many reviewers are complaining about the difficulty, but it isn't that hard if you know what you're doing (finished my first run on my 2nd try and subsequently I've cleared 3/8 times). Sadly Wildfrost falls short of a lot of balancing problems with the interactive systems in the game. I really hope the developers continue updating the game and releasing more content. The game is lacking in content. Already 8 hours in and I have over half of all unlockables done and all factions unlocked. For $20 it seems to have around 10 - 15 hours of content, after that it's just the game itself and let me tell you there are huge problems here.\n\nI'm going to assume you already looked at other reviewers and saw the comparisons to Slay the Spire & Monster Train. I won't bore you with those details. Instead I'll focus on the huge problems with the balancing:\n\nDo note there will be slight spoilers in this.\n\n1) By far the most egregious problem has to be after you clear a run. After you complete a run the final boss becomes you, except it's not exactly the same as you because the AI also has extra benefits that your character doesn't have. Usually this is in the form of increased stats or abilities for the main character + all the companions used. There is a problem with this if you cannot already see it. Eventually you'll reach a point where your team was so good at clearing the run, that you yourself will have an extremely difficult time clearing it. Even if you manage to clear the boss, you'll have to get an even better team the next time to clear again... it's a very deteriorating motivator. I have no idea how the developers thought this was balanced because it isn't balanced at all. I've gotten to the final boss 3 times since I last cleared and failed every single time. I just cannot clear the strategy of my final team.\n\n2) Cards & Companions are too RNG dependent. In Monster Train you had a limited selection of the pool of two different factions. In Slay the Spire each character has its own specific pool of cards available (excluding colorless cards). In Wildfrost there does appear to be a limited pool for each faction, but it's very small... too small. There's also neutral Companions and Cards that are available for all factions that further dilutes this pool making strategies pretty difficult to create. This is further exacerbated by the fact that you are FORCED to actually choose cards or companions regardless of whether they suit your playstyle or not. Removing cards is not done possible through the shop system, but through an event that is usually on a different path from the shop which is the only place you can actually buy important upgrades.\n\n3) Speaking of upgrades... it's a very different system. Both Monster Train and Slay the Spire have unique upgrade paths for cards and monsters (in the case of Monster Train). In Wildfrost upgrades are not unique, but generalistic. When you go to an upgrade shop (or an upgrade node) you get a random chance to get upgrades from a very large pool. Let's say you get a health increase upgrade. You can put that on your companion to increase their health or put it on a healing spell to increase the healing potential. Similarly, a shield upgrade can be used to give +1 shield to a companion or +1 shield gain on a spell. The upgrades are permanent and you cannot remove them. The problem here is again the pool is far too vast on what is available in the upgrade shop. You can go to a shop and get upgrades for things you do not need or cannot use, it's a completely random system. You can imagine the frustration of spending all your gold trying to get a health upgrade for  your tank only to get nothing even useable.\n\n\nIt's a shame too because the artstyle is unique and the combat system itself is well balanced and very fun to engage in. The problem is the systems that are supposed to support the combat actively hurt it or are a hinderance. I really hope the developer and publisher don't give up on this game, I'd love to come back to it in a few months and try it out again, hopefully when things are more polished.",0
136612542,1811990,"Fun and refreshing rogue like. There are so many unique game play mechanics that are not in other games of the genre. I don't understand people who are saying it's too hard. It definitely requires a lot of thinking, but in the three runs I played so far, I reached the final boss twice and beat it once.",1
136612370,1811990,"As a million people have correctly warned in these negative reviews, this game has a very great potential. It's 90% there, but that 10% flaw of terrible balancing, is making it wear thin quickly. \n\nThere are so many points in its favor: \n- The quirky style, so much personality!\n- Fabulous music\n- Beautifully polished visuals make every moment a joy for the eyes\n- The Charms, I can add a bunch on one card, so satisfying!!\n\nHowever I am currently giving this a negative review to help add pressure for some easing-off on the overly difficult balancing. It's so weird to see a game that went so far out of its way to be friendly, as if it's made for stupid people even, and yet at the same time try its hardest to screw you over with enemies suddenly appearing that seem to be way over your level. What's most frustrating, is that the bosses almost always have immunity to 'slow', which alone would have allowed me to barely squeak out a win, otherwise. Why make the bosses immune, if they're already overpowered? Let me use my tools at least... \n\nI want to enjoy this game, so devs please listen to the crowd and just tweak balancing so it's a bit more reasonable, and not dependent on getting lucky with overpowered builds. If that adjustment happens, and you make a clear statement that it's been addressed so we can take another look at it, my review is likely to swap to positive.",0

136668319,1811990,"I was a bit turned off from getting the game, since it's currently sitting at an unsteady 60% review ratio. Now I will say the game isn't ridiculously hard as it sounded like it would be, but there is a lot going on and if you miss an effect that an enemy has or misalign your characters, it could result in a bit of a mess or injuries to a character or two!\n\nBut the fact that one of the more popular reviews states that they had 20 runs in 3 hours, and had somehow managed to die in the first battle is shocking! In my 3 hours I had 4 solid runs and made it to the third zone, with each run being a different unique setup than the last. I made a mistake or two in a couple runs which didn't ultimately end them and still did alright.\n\nKing Moko specifically was rather daunting, but I made it through the fight by quickly bursting him down with debuffs and sun rods. However the third zone though with wild boars I fucked up real fast and attacked one with my leader and died instantly. That, while frustratingly silly, was totally on me and forgot he'd just counter attack twice. \n\nOtherwise I played at a bit of a slower more meticulous pace, paying attention to enemies that had effects like giving armor to other enemies, or the enemy that causes aimless on your party and targeted them with cards rather than depending solely on my party. Switching people around to avoid big hits and using weak dummy deployables to tank big hits was very important for fights.\n\nI'm not a fan of card games at all (Slay the Spire being the ONLY other one I play), but it isn't impossible to get into. There are a lot of ways to approach fights with cards, and if you don't figure them out you may struggle a bit with the game since it's less straight forward than Slay the Spire since you have a field of characters to manage that attack independently of played cards like the freeze attacks and such.\n\nTLDR: The game has a lot of charm, the artstyle is lovely, and the music is great. There's a decent variety of build potential with cards, and it is super satisfying to figure out what works with what. It rewards patient play and a bit of experimenting. However, some enemy effects (eg. causing aimless to your party) can be frustrating since the fight partially is out of your control and you have to rely on in hand cards and a bit of luck on top of that.\n\nOverall I'd rate it positively, but a couple battles can prove to be frustrating but it isn't anywhere what I expected from some of the reviews and the 60% rating. Of course it's still an early review so it should be taken with a grain of salt and ideally it could use some adjustments too.",1
136668150,1811990,"Super fun and very well designed game aesthetically. Easy to pick up, but theres a fair amount of complexity in store to dive into. Most of the negative reviews seem to be for how difficult the game is and that it is too hard, but personally I did not find that to be the case and I won the first two runs I played back to back (sample size of two) with wildly different decks, and I had plenty of misplays in those runs as well.",1

136668870,1091920,"One of the things I enjoyed most about Plantera 2 is the variety of plants and animals available in the game. There's a wide range of different species that can be grown, from fruit trees to flowers and vegetables. There's also a great variety of animals that can be raised, such as chickens, cows, and sheep. Additionally, there's a large number of items to unlock, such as gardening equipment and farm decorations.\n\nThe gameplay in Plantera 2 is very fun and addictive. The game starts with a small and simple farm, but as the player earns more money, they can expand the farm and purchase new plants and animals. There's also the possibility of hiring workers to help care for the animals and plants. However, as the farm grows, it also becomes more difficult to manage, making the game challenging.\n\nThe graphics in Plantera 2 are excellent, with a lot of attention to detail. The characters and animals are well-designed and the colors are bright and cheerful. The soundtrack is relaxing and helps create a peaceful and pleasant atmosphere.\n\nAlthough I enjoyed Plantera 2 very much, there are some weaknesses in the game. The lack of a plot or story can make the game a bit monotonous and without a clear goal. Additionally, the gameplay can become repetitive after a while, especially if the player has already unlocked most of the plants and animals.\n\nOverall, Plantera 2 is a fun and engaging game with many plants, animals, and items to unlock. While the lack of a plot may be somewhat disappointing for some players, the gameplay itself is very satisfying and addictive. If you enjoy simulation and farm management games, I recommend giving Plantera 2 a try.",1

136669195,1364020,The game is more finished than I expected. The 3-dimensional space movement allows players to combat in smaller maps with more tactics. Great game for a decent price. You certainly wouldn't miss it.  It a game where you can lost sense-of-direction and engage enemy with fierce movement that doesn't present in other FPS.,1
136668311,1364020,"I was really enthusiastic to see the gameplay previews of Boundary, and now that it's here, I am hoping this game succeeds. Where a lot of other FPS titles on Steam have brought unique concepts to the table and stumbled in a few key areas (content delivery being a huge issue), I hope Boundary's dev team learns and is able to create a living game that improves over time. So far, I am pleased to see the developers responding to English-language feedback and I hope that continues further into the game's development cycle. \n\nSince Boundary is releasing in Early Access and I'm writing this review on Day 1, I am hoping to write down a few thoughts to inform prospective players. Following are some plusses and minuses that I've experienced in the game as-is:\n\nPROS:\n-Delivers fantastically well on the premise. The sound quality is impeccable as well as the visual fidelity, and Boundary is very immersive as a result. You can see tracers and the Sun reflected off your helmet. Your character breathes heavily and you can hear the oxygen rushing out of your suit. Sound doesn't travel in space, and the game is starkly quiet as a result (but still full of rich sound design) I have spent the last hour in game goggling at my surroundings with my headphones at full volume to appreciate what this game has going on. It's really well done in all aspects, including in the menus.\n-The game's visual design is great- the UI/HUD elements and ingame assets fit really well with the theme and everything goes together nicely. It remains to be seen where cosmetics will be taken (and I really hope against all odds they stick to the theme of high-tech space). \n-The gunplay is extremely satisfying when it's flowing well- when everything clicks it feels really well done. AAA quality for sure.\n-The movement is mostly well considered and feels very fluid despite your character being in a clunky spacesuit. The grapple and boost mechanic are great for getting around.\n-I appreciate the small aesthetic flairs- the weapon animations are nearly fantastic throughout (with a few small janks here and there), and I am a big fan of the character flairs given to each class. \n-Stability is great so far. Have not experienced any frame drops, lags, stutters, or crashes (thank UE4)\n\nCONS:\n-The translation quality to English is very poor at this time. A few things remain in Chinese, and the menu elements are pretty poorly translated throughout. The entire game needs a thorough pass by a trained localization team. \n-The HUD (ESPECIALLY the customization menu) has some information but is lacking many critical details. I saw a community guide up earlier that EXPLAINED each side pod's function, which is notably lacking from the game itself. Good luck trying to figure out what anything does at this point.\n-A lot of gameplay elements are questionably balanced and don't seem to serve a function at this time. For example, there is a medic class but there isn't really a tangible purpose to healing your teammates as everyone is very dispersed around the map- and it's really difficult to land the healing device (?) anyways. \n-Some QoL stuff is missing, including what is mentioned above. You can't exit out of a match in the pre-game lobby, and the pre-round timer is too long.\n-Some of the maps are not very good. The crash site one invites a lot of pot shots from across the map and a single choke point (a choke point in space! can you believe that?) contains a lot of the fighting.\n-Engagement distances are kinda funky as CQC is rare- it's weird to figure out where the shotguns and SMGs will be effective compared to longer-distance weapons.\n-For some people, the unlocked axes of movement could probably cause motion sickness.\n-Some aspects of the movement are questionable- the landed state is clunky to move to and from, and the momentum brake isn't so useful when you can stop as is. Stick to the grapple for now.\n-The tutorials are adequate but leave out lots of helpful info. See above regarding the lack of info in menus.\n-The game desperately needs a region lock, and maybe more servers. I am playing against China/SEA players with 300+ ping on a regular basis.\n\n\nNEUTRAL:\n-A lot of the cosmetics in the game so far are directed towards a Chinese audience. Expect a lot of the items ingame right now to seem a bit strange out of context.\n-I have heard some reservations from others about the Tencent anticheat but I would wager Tencent has as much data from me as Denuvo and EAC at this point. Download at your peril!!!\n\nOVERALL:\n\nThe game is not anywhere near a finished state, which is to be expected in Early Access. I am still really excited to see Boundary improve over time, and I think it has the bones of a very solid, high skill gap, beloved competitive/casual FPS. The developers will undoubtedly encounter rampant sinophobia in a western audience and the challenge will be to warm people up to the unusual concept of space combat, but even in an early state, I can see a lot of love and polish in Boundary. \n\n\nVerdict: Maybe wait awhile to purchase as the game is pretty unpolished on Day 1. The price is more than reasonable for what's on offer at $25. I will come back to update this review as the game changes.",1

136669456,1651560,"Absolutely adorable game. I had already put a couple of hours into the demo so I was very excited and waiting for this game to come out on early access and it is great. I love the narrator and the art style is so cute. I like that it has all of the foundation and mechanics from most city builder games, but has more of a cozy gaming feel where you can just sit back and relax while designing your fairytale kingdom. \n\nScrolling through the kingdom can get very slow and laggy if you unlock a lot of the map, but that may be my computer not being very good. I\u2019m really excited to see more of the world map interactions with other kingdoms. Disappointed to find out that castles and a other food source buildings won\u2019t be available for a while, but I rather have early access and be here through the process than wait for the game to be fully done. \n\nOverall this game is so much fun. I was able to put in a lot of hours first day until I finished all early access content\u2026. And then an hour or two more after that. And in excited to check out the creative mode and build some monstrous cities. Devs should be proud. \n",1
136668743,1651560,"Great little game. Peaceful to play, but you still need to manage your resources. I think it needs some tuning during EA.

The other method, I'd call it \""sticks controls\"" method, is way better from a \""gameplay\"" perspective (and I feel good with triggers for \""world\"" rotation).\nAs far as I played, I've had a good fun. Some items interactions are a little \""clunky\"", however the in-game puzzles are cool and the exploration is interesting. \nGood game, for a very  low price. \nRecommended, especially for kids, or if you want a stress-free experience!\n",1

136669888,1968710,"My immediate response to the ending was \""NO! [i]NO![/i] THAT CAN'T BE IT! [i][b]THERE MUST BE MORE![/b][/i]\""\n\nSo yes, I liked the game so much that my biggest issue is how short it is. Unlike [u]Portal[/u], [u]MEATGRINDER[/u] doesn't really have the writing or story\u2014nay, not even the pretence for a thrilling climax. Thrilling set pieces, most certainly, each one better than the last, but the game doesn't so much reach a satisfying finish as it does just end. There are a couple of cool bosses in the game but we don't get one very last boss to wrap things up, like a giant robot spider using tanks as skates.\n\nBut those set pieces really are good, I must say. From the very second level, jumping between trucks and flinging away bandits running and jumping at you never stops being fun, and then they just keep introducing new elements in each level to make it so much more fun and exciting! Having said that, while the final two levels are visually striking and dynamic, enemy placement is repeated and the gameplay loop doesn't flow as well so shooting enemies isn't particularly fun in them. However, as the levels are pretty damn short and it IS an amazing visual spectacle, it's not a problem at all as you'll only go through them once anyway.\n\nI have a few more issues:\n[list]\n    [*]Not all weapons are created equally. The minigun feels and sounds rather underpowered compared to everything else and it heats up way too quickly. Also, there's really no reason to use the pistols once you've gotten the second weapon.\n    [*]Hard Mode is, ironically, too hard. I think it's fine to punish the player more for falling on the road but a one-hit kill is far too unforgiving when the game is so chaotic that what you're standing on can just leave you far too suddenly and get you killed, or car placements are too far spread out that it's impossible to advance. \n    [*]The game is... visually weird? When enemies are close to me, it's hard to register a lot. I kick at them but there's little in the way of visceral feedback that tells me I've actually done it apart from the enemy suddenly not being in front of me anymore. Same goes for when I'm shooting them with the pistols. I guess this combines with the minigun issue of weapons lacking solid feedback, which could be remedied by sound effects.\n    [*]I get you're inspired by [u]ULTRAKILL[/u], what with the graphics and that whole three-line intro bit at the start, but those things are just cheesy. Those things aren't what make [u]ULTRAKILL[/u] great and having those elements don't make you [u]ULTRAKILL[/u]. This game sets itself apart in so many wonderful ways while being alike in so many wonderful ways so those things just baffle me, really.\n[/list]\nOverall, though, I loved [u]MEATGRINDER[/u]. The sheer creativity and thrill behind every moment of the game makes me very excited for what Vampire Squid do next. I WILL say that, while I can appreciate a game focusing on gameplay over story, there's no reason why they can't intersect and work off each other. All games are enriched with context and boomer shooters are no different; [u]Metal: Hellsinger[/u]'s one example of this and even [u]DOOM[/u] 2016 uses the themes of the original [u]Doom[/u]'s tropes as good storytelling devices, from the Doom Slayer's violent reactions to everything and his lack of speaking. \n\nI'm not going to ask for long cutscenes and exposition. This game is, after all, about flow, and cutscenes like that would be just as flowbreaking as Hard Mode with all the deaths on the road. But surely the gameplay itself could tell the story; voice lines from your avatar that aren't pop culture references, enemy designs and voice lines, and even the set pieces themselves could result from decisions made by everyone involved in this crazy imminent pile-up. All the same, this was really cool.",1
136669699,1567000,"Just finished the game and gotta say it has a style. It's not pretending to copy modern shooters or create new mechanics. It's just let you follow the flow and get the vibes with absolutely fantastic level art and music.\n\""Crazy\"" atmospehere of the game and all that inspiration from classic artists and sculpturs supported by music which let you escape from reality and forget about all others needs.\nI think a good advice on clearing levels is to follow the pace of the evironment - do not hurry and look around you.

136671218,1811990,"I'll echo what some of the other positive reviews are saying: a lot of the negative reviews are just a skill issue. Period. I think that there are legitimate criticisms to be made with the game, but my god. As of writing this review the game is sitting at a 60% review score and that is just simply unfair. One of the top reviews as my writing this complains that they died multiple times in the first fight in the run and that they had 20 runs in 3 hours. Having played around 5 hours myself, and having no prior experience with deckbuilders in the past, I can honestly say I have no fucking clue how that dude managed to lose the first fight enough times that they felt it necessary to note it in their review. \n\nThe game is challenging. It is, sometimes frustrating, but I can honestly say that most of my deaths have been because I made a mistake, and I was playing too fast. Some reviews are complaining about needing some crazy luck or needing a perfect build, and that is just not at all true. I think maybe one of my runs was extremely lucky, and it wasn't the run that made it to the end. With smart play, making the most of your resources, and attention, you can make the most out of the vast majority of your runs. I can not emphasize enough that the reviews blasting the game about horrific balance and extreme difficulty are likely playing too quickly, just generally, but certainly in battles (once again, as a complete newcomer to the genre, no clue how one would manage 20 runs in 3 hours). And to say that the different enemy types require an exact \""answer\"" is just flat out wrong. A wide array of strategies are entirely viable, and I've had great success with several, frankly entirely unoptimized builds. The game requires careful thought and each decision. It isn't \""impossibly difficult,\"" it just requires patience and for you to not rush through every turn. I don't mean to outright attack other reviewers, but I worry the review score will drive away prospective new players. Most of the negative reviews are severely misguided, and clearly aren't engaging in good faith with the mechanics the game provides.\n\nI can't say it is perfect, but I can say I've had a great amount of fun with it, and the current review score is criminal. It could absolutely do with some tuning, I can't disagree there, there are certainly some cards that just feel worthless, but to say that the majority are unusable is laughable. There is a legitimate criticism to be made in the games draw system, as it at no point informs you that you will be able plan out your future hands by looking at your deck and your discard pile. This is an extremely important mechanic, as it eliminates a rather large random element, and I only discovered it on accident.\n\nThe design, both visual and sound, are delightful, and full of little touches that show that the devs clearly had a great deal of passion for this game, and a great deal of enjoyment for it. Please, please don't be swayed by some of the less charitable reviews. The game is more than worth your time, and I don't regret my purchase for a second. I rarely if ever write reviews, but I felt I had to for this game. If I had to give a rating, it would be sitting much close to 85%. There are legitimate criticisms to be made with this, in terms of some design aspects and balance, but it's hard to have that discussion when the majority of the negative reviews I've seen have been made seemingly in bad faith by people that grew frustrated with a game that demanded their attention.\n\nThis game is not \""impossibly hard.\"" This game is not \""all rng.\"" It requires time, attention, and a great deal of player input for every decision. Saying that there is very little the player can influence or do is a flat out lie. I have saved what seemed like unwinable positions and lost what seemed like a sure thing, entirely on my own competence.\n\nIt's a good game",1

To the point of sometimes distracting you form the actual gameplay to just appreciate them. The tactical nature of the combat with the positioning of your units feels very rewarding when you begin to understand it. Also, the way you constantly keep unlocking new stuff via small achievements is great.\n\nNow is the game hard? Yes, a lot, but It's certainly not unbeatable. I don't know why people are so focused on winning the video game that they can't appreciate the process of loosing, figuring out why, learning from it, and trying new strategies. I can say for sure that I had a lot more fun getting absolutely wrecked in this game than \""winning\"" so many others like it.\n\nIt's not perfect and I get that It might not be for everyone, but if you like other games of the genre and like a good challenge, don't be intimidated by the negative reviews and give it a try.",1

136670663,1798010,"Mega Man Battle Network Legacy Collection Vol. 1 is a compilation of the first three games in the Mega Man Battle Network series, which are action-RPGs that combine real-time combat with grid-based strategy. The games follow the adventures of Lan and his NetNavi MegaMan.EXE, who fight against various cyber-threats in a futuristic world where everything is connected to the internet. The games feature a unique battle system that allows the player to customize MegaMan's abilities with various chips and programs, and also switch between different battle styles that affect his stats and skills. The games also have a rich story that explores themes such as friendship, family, identity, and morality.\n\nThe Mega Man Battle Network Legacy Collection Vol. 1 is a great way to experience these classic games that have aged well and still offer a lot of fun and challenge. The collection also includes some bonus features such as concept art, music player, and online netbattling and trading. The games have been enhanced with HD graphics as well as E-Reader patch cards (in Volume 2) which were previously only available in Japan.

136673430,1798010,"Even before playing this I was pretty likely recommending it. The games themselves are good as it is, but Capcom went the extra mile and gave us online functionality and even made sure things like event-only distributions are accounted for here. The packed gallery and BGM player along with a nice suite of options means that this is THE way to play Battle Network.\n\nUnlike the X Collection or the Classic Legacy Collection, the general change in style between 1-3 and 4-6 mean splitting this up into 2 volumes is definitely a smart move. Even with how the game changes between the two halves, it never truly feels like 1 through 3 are obsolete games. They still have a lot of good to offer and are totally worth picking up, but I can see why some people would stick to either Volume 1 or Volume 2 on their own.\n\nAs for the games themselves, what's there to say that hasn't been said already? Battle Network 1 is rough around the edges in a lot of ways, but the core ideas are there for a very fun game. You might want to play it first if you feel like you're not going to appreciate how much changed over time, or you might want to come back to it when you've seen why people love this series so much. Just bring a map with you because getting lost can happen often.\n\n2 improves on just about everything that people had issue with in 1. It's still got some issues, but it definitely feels like a much more cohesive product with a refined look and feel. I remember this also having way more bonkers online than any other game in the series, with so many cheese strats and lopsided balance that can be fun, but may not be for you.\n\n3 is definitely the peak of the series. It's not downhill, but everything just seems to come together perfectly for 3. Further fine tuning to the gameplay, the addition of the Navi Customizer to let you enhance Mega Man in all manner of ways, slightly better balance among the Style Change forms, and a meatier story that gives us a suitable finale for what can be considered the first \""arc\"". The version split, while definitely a way to cash in on the Pokemon trend in some ways, does have some viability in Battle Network, with a unique boss in either version and some unique chips in each library. However, Punk is only actually in Blue, since Blue is actually just the enhanced version of Battle Network 3 made to look like a separate version. Tut tut, Capcom. At least later games actually are built with version differences in mind.\n\nBattle Network is probably a cornerstone franchise for the GBA, and for many is going to be how they first found Mega Man. It's great to have them in this form, including online functionality, and even if you're not into Mega Man, you'd be getting into a rock solid action RPG with a unique setting and unique mechanics that has a ton of content worth sinking your teeth into.",1
136687118,1974290,"A great addition to Sentinels of the Multiverse. The heroes are on the higher end of the power spectrum (looking at you Captain Thunder) and they all feel different. The villains are tough and the environments are mean. Game plays flawlessly with either version that you have. The artwork causes a bit of a clash with the original Sentinels, but that's more of an IP thing as SoEP is based off a TTRPG.\n\nThe game does still needs a patch or two to smooth it out (the font looks kinda fuzzy to read and sometimes the text is partially broken/split on cards) and we don't have the variants for heroes nor the additional DLC content of the missing 2 heroes and 1 of the others. Still, glad to have this as it's always nice to have more content.",1

136688269,1811990,"Visually speaking, this game is incredibly fun and appealing. I really enjoy the designs of the in-game world and characters. The art style of this game is one of the main reasons I bought it in the first place and it continues to deliver! A+\n\nWhile I won't claim to be an expert on roguelike deckbuilders, the gameplay feels (to me, at least) pretty solid. The game has plenty of fun mechanics and strategies, though it can be a bit hard implementing them sometimes, given some of the RNG elements. Then again, maybe that's to be expected with these games?\n\nFor the most part, this game is fun to play. It's challenging, as is to be expected, though at times I feel like the game is almost a bit too challenging. Like I said: I'm not an expert on these things, so I'm not gonna delve too deep into it. Maybe some balance changes are in order? But given the game's recent release, I think that's a fair thing to expect.\n\nOverall solid game! Appealing visuals. Solid gameplay. Would recommend.

136687722,1811990,"Really fun, many times a fight seems insurmountable and I'll just squeak by. I understand the complaints about difficulty, but it's not hard just to be hard. It's hard with a purpose, it makes you think about every small decision and the decisions do really add up. I played a ton of the demo and managed to beat it consistently by the end of my time with it. I've played this for a little while and haven't beaten it yet but consistently get to the same place as the demo. Now there's a new roadblock to plan for and scheme around, and it's fun all over again. Most importantly though, the game is still a lot of fun even when you lose. It doesn't feel like a slog at all, especially since you get all of your health back after a fight. One tip for just starting out: don't forget to heal your companion cards, it makes a huge difference to how much you can block.",1
136687705,1811990,"With it's great card art and presentation, you can really feel that the devs put lots of love into their work. \n\nUnfortunately, I didn't really have much fun playing the game itself. Can't put a finger on it, but somehow it didn't click for me like Slay the Spire did. I had a similar problem with Monster Train, so maybe it's the pseudo tower-defense nature of this game and Monster Train that I don't like.

Each fight is an elaborate puzzle, and the game gives you exactly what you need to overcome it, if you can find the line.\n\nThere's lots to unlock (although I am finding it a bit hard to \""focus down\"" certain achievements intentionally, so I may have to just wait for the right chance to come along), and seeing the town of Snowdwell grow is a cozy visual delight, much like everything else the game.\n\nMy most important question: Monchi plush when??",1

136685240,2328760,"To start off, I bought Pinball FX 3 last year without being aware that there was a newer version named \""Pinball FX\"" available elsewhere. I bought my Pinball FX 3 tables again for this Pinball FX released on Epic Games assuming I was loosing money but that the game experience would be better, it isn't. I've waited a bit since on Epic Games it turns out the game was kind of a pre-release. Playing with this newer steam version, I'm figuring out I need to buy those damn tables again and the game suffers from the same problems Pinball FX on Epic Games had. The ball feels sluggish and the gameplay's inferior to Pinball FX3 in every ways. The sounds is worst and some titles seems to be lacking the original OST from movies etc... There's no excuse for tables of that price, even the flippers samples (the sounds it makes) sounds worst and they phase-cancel each other if left and right plays at the same time. This is pure cash milking. It seems there's no way to turn off tables animations (like this annoying dragons that hides the table while flying around during Medieval Madness's multiballs.

I don't see why any multiplayer game (barring cod) is buy-to-play. If you make a game, and charge people to play it, fewer people will play it. You aren't cod, people aren't going to buy the game just for existing.\nLook at the sorry state of Naraka: Bladepoint. Awesome and unique game just like this one. Yet the playerbase is so low its hard to even play the game outside of Asian servers.\n\nI hope for the best though. As long as I get like 100 hrs or so in before it dies I will be happy.",1

136687500,1183800,"Shardpunk: Verminfall \ud83d\udc00 -  New 2D tactical game that XCOM fans gotta love!\n\nIt's basically designed for turn-based tactics enjoyers. You have your XCOM gameplay, you have your \""rest/camping\"" gameplay between stages with resource management like Darkest Dungeon or Star Renegades, and no meta progression, instead, you get achievement/unlock system, like Into The Breach, where you expand your options on how to start/create/manage your party, rather than getting powercreep. If I am gonna call a direct game comparison, Pathway (and Halfway to a degree too) is the closest, and as it turns out after I asked the lead dev the question of inspirations, Pathway was correct!\n\nNot gonna cover the game balance as I am not that deep yet for that (and something tells me, there are gonna be some broken combinations of abilities/weapon upgrades as expected), but the gameplay loop itself isn't that complicated, so don't worry about experimenting, you will always get resources, especially if you follow game's mechanics of Combat Tactics. Besides, it's all about fun, don't worry about balance, just kill as many vermin as you can, and try again if your party falls.\n\nI also had Lead Dev on the line with me when I was streaming, if you want a deeper look into the game, check out the video below.

The dev describes it as a horror game too, but there are not so many (if any) scary moments in the game. When the game starts you wake up in a cell, and you will have to find your way out of the house and cover your tracks at the same time so that the kidnapper will not notice that you are trying to escape, otherwise he will kill you, the game will end and you are going to have to start it from the beginning. Its graphics are far from the ultra-realistic ones, but they are pleasant, the story is interesting, the sounds are ok and the atmosphere is lacking a little bit. Also, I did not managed to find the right switch combination yet, so I'm stuck for now :(",1
136688014,2329130,Great experience,1

136688055,1409300,"Adventure game featuring incredibly detailed pixel visuals, outstanding atmosphere, intriguing plot, and unremarkable combat system and encounters.\n\nThe atmosphere and graphics are fantastic. The buys streets, people going around, walls filled with colorful ads. This cannot be seen in the game's images, but witnessing it in action is a very different matter. The game also makes use of 3D concepts to generate depth and space, even if the majority of the world is made up of pixelated 2D images. This means that even though you remain restricted to moving only left and right on a single plane, the world continues to turn and your perspective is shifting. \n\nInteraction with the world is done through a single button. Press it when you're standing on top of something interesting and your protagonist will take the appropriate action automatically. Most of the items or hotspots have no use and can be only inspected. This gives the game's overall lore a little more flavor.\n\nWhen an object is useful, it will have a faint glow to make it easier for you to spot it in the detailed locations. The inventory will automatically open where it is required, so the game even helps you out when an item needs to be used on the hotspot. Puzzles are limited to numbered locks and a simple hacking mini game.\n\nThe fact that previously useless things can be used when the story demands it and new hotspots appear when none previously existed is a minor problem that can be seen in many other games. When you believe you've examined an area completely but return and discover what you're seeking for, this may cause some confusion. \n\nYou\u2019re able to perform a bunch of additional moves such as run, roll and attack. Your stamina is depleted throughout all action moves, but that is rarely a problem because it regenerates quickly. You can consume an energy bar if you really find yourself in a bind and require a rapid boost of stamina, but that doesn\u2019t happen often.\n\nSituations can be solved with violence or stealth. Despite the lack of a manual save option, the autosave works well with checkpoints. Sneaking is particularly efficient and a bit broken. If you\u2019re crouching behind an object and even have a part of your body sticking out, the enemy won\u2019t see you. And even if you get caught, you can run to the next room to escape detection. The most peculiar part, though, is that you can punch enemies while hiding behind cover, and they will simply ignore you.\n\nCombat is basic. You can either use a taser gun to knock targets out from a distance or engage in some good old button-mashing melee. You don't have to worry about it because there are ammo and bandages available everywhere there's a chance of getting into a fight. \n\nThe fact that voice acting only appears in cutscenes and not in the main game is actually a positive. The voices just don't feel right, and several have strong accents that many gamers could find unpleasant.",1
136690642,1949030,"I couldn't bring myself to leave a negative review as I love this series so much, but I can't believe the game is over already. And I left the game on in the background for most of one day. Then again, hat's off to the developers for delivering the game during an invasion. \n\nIf you love Cthulu and the Chapter One Sherlock then absolutely, go for it (on sale). It is beautiful, but to be honest, I would probably play anything in this art style with these voice actors (hearing Sherlock and Holmes bicker is precious and I personally love this representation of Sherlock). But the game is not very Sherlock Holmes. Nor is it very Cthulhu. It's also crazily overpriced for what it is, and feels very restrictive after experiencing Cordona. The map is less than helpful as there is no marker to show where you are, and I had a couple of crashes so make sure to save. Some of the dialogue choices do matter as well and getting the wrong one means replaying a section which becomes tedious very quickly. \n\nOn the plus side (for me), there was no fighting save for the odd quick time event, with much of the action handled in cut scenes. It was also nice to experience their first case together (although I wouldn't have realised this if I hadn't read the Steam update). Did I mention the art style and voice-acting? Also, this game gives me hope for another open-world in the future as they nailed London in all it's grimy glory (very Thief-esque) and New Orleans gave me wonderful Black Flag vibes (I kept trying to climb up all the buildings!). \n\nSo, yes. A beautiful game reminiscent of a 3D visual novel with puzzles, but it's for you to decide whether 9/10 hours of intermittent Sherlock and Watson banter is worth the (current) price tag.",1
136689057,1949030,"I must thank again my dear friend for gifting this to me :> I had a blast playing this game in ungodly nights. \n\nYou would love this game for its:\n1. Immersive story and amazing soundtracks\n2. Sherlock and Watson's dynamics (plus sassy banters)\n3. Compelling visuals (the artworks for this my god thank you for the free wallpapers)\n4. Historical appreciations (thank you for the bonus content)\n5. Clearer cut investigative+puzzle gameplay (as someone who plays the older Sherlock titles by Frogwares... you know if you know)\n6. Dressing up young Sherlock and Watson (Frogwares was very generous for coming up with a lot even by the Standard version)\n7. Gore, body horror, the works \n8. Mind Palace game mechanic remains \n9. Amazing voice acting! \n10. Very helpful Boswell (again, coming from the older Sherlock games, I am loving this new version of Watson by Frogwares)\n\nHowever, you may not enjoy this game if you're expecting:\n1. Open-world (you can explore around but there's hardly any interaction)\n2. Very challenging puzzles (based on the difficulty settings, you'll only be rid of hints and icons for investigating locations but the puzzles remains the same)\n3. Gunning down THE Cthulhu (but you DO carry a gun ;>)\n4. [spoiler] \""Open-ending\"" (sort of, because the way they concluded the story suggests it's more on interpretation) [/spoiler] ending\n5. The Cthulhu Mythos driving the story forward [spoiler] (It feels more of a colossal plot device for the main characters' development- and what drives Sherlock to insanity lel) [/spoiler] (they can change that up to just all about a random cult and there would be not much of a difference)\n6. Long playtime (even with the DLCs, I gather finishing the game will take you only about 20 hours)\n7. Bug-free experience (I have encountered bugs and errors here and there but it did not break the gameplay in my case, but Idk maybe some people are looking for something closer to perfect)\n8. Jumpscares or whatever you expect of a horror game (you won't feel scared, just surprised or chilly due to the on-point ambiance and atmosphere)\n\nAdditional notes:\n1. I wish the horror aspect feels more real to the player (throughout the game, I don't feel any tension with anything even if I \""die\"" and I feel no stakes to the big moments) [spoiler] case in point, Heidi. I honestly don't feel the \""consequences\"" [/spoiler]\n2. I think there's more to the \""hallucinations\"" Sherlock is experiencing but wasn't given opportunity to come to its full potential (the trailers and description is hyping all about it, but it was all meh to me at the end)\n3. Comparing it to the previous Awakened, they've done great with this Remake (Sherlock and the player has the similar pacing when figuring out things, I appreciate that a lot *internal sobbing*)\n\nConclusion: If you're pretty new to the Frogwares games, you're welcome to try this out first as this is more casual-friendly. That being said, if you're expecting something that is listed at the con section, you may not enjoy it at all. Add to the fact that this is quite pricey especially when compared to Chapter One, which I've heard has a ton more to offer plus longer playtime.\n\nAlso take note, this is the sequel to Sherlock Holmes Chapter One, so if you're looking forward to the story more than the rest, you might as well start with Chapter One instead. Then again, as someone who hasn't played Chapter One, I don't have trouble following through the story. All up to you. \n\nKudos to the team for making this Remake despite all they've gone through. Even with all the flaws aforementioned, it's amazing how the team concoct a very solid game as this despite their situation. Slava Ukraini!\n",1
136688578,1949030,"If you played Chapter One and enjoyed it, you will enjoy this. A much darker game, though Chapter One had dark moments. It's a crossover with Lovecraft, so expect gore and mind trippy visual effects. The puzzles were not difficult once you realized what was being asked of you. I hope in future games Frogwares will bring back the style of puzzles from their previous games. Great voice acting. I only encountered one crash to desktop which I could not reproduce. I like this version of Sherlock and hope Frogwares continues with this version of the character. Enjoy.",1

Maybe there is a possibilty to stretch the ascension modes out, so the base game is a little bit more forgiving, but with 3 bells enabled, there are still many ways to craft a good team. Not every run is meant to beat the end boss, but that's fine.\nHoping for more content soon!",1
136693936,1811990,"I've played this game a little bit, so I feel as though I can say with confidence that it is a good game. In fact, I think it's a fantastic. I've played my fair share of rogue-like deck-builders like Slay the Spire, Monster Train, and Dicey Dungeons and I believe that in many regards Wildfrost is at least on par with them in most ways. If you want to save some time looking through reviews I'll say this: If you like the games previously mentioned, and are willing to loose most of your runs (at least at the start) and are down for a challenging experience that rewards you for game knowledge and perseverance with unique mechanics and a style and direction wholly unique for the genre then pick it up. It's obviously not perfect. The reason why this game has a mixed reviews (as of now) is because people believe that the game is so atrociously balanced that's its almost unplayable. I will be the first to admit that the balancing needs some work. Sometimes your starting heroes are so bad that you might as well throw in the towel in your first combat. Sometimes you'll enter a combat where, if you happen to draw a bad opening hand you might just loose (I'm looking at you early poison).\nThere's also the teeth cave. \nI do not like the teeth cave.\nThere is more, but to go as far as to say it is unplayable is just not true. And it becomes easier as you keep playing and you learn what works and what doesn't, when you unlock new cards, and you know what to look out for. Wildfrost is a great game that may or may not require some patience and some tweaking (which the devs have already admitted in a recent post) but it is a shame that a game this fun with a incredible style that completely contradicts it's difficultly is sitting at (as of now) 60% positive reviews, which obviously is really bad for a rep of a game that just came out. I just hope that people who like the game find it and maybe can help stabilize that score. \nAlso, pro tip, pick Blunky every time you see him, trust me he is for sure the strongest companion in the game.",1

[b]Definitely![/b]\nBut a few of my problems with it and i hope the devs adress in the future are\n\n1- [b] Give me a quick reset button please. [/b] Or at least let me pick the one leader between all of them not just 3. Is ok to try to force the player a bit to experiment new things but i think that is a very hard task to do in deck builder games. Sometimes i don't want to have an aimless leader, nor want one with extra junk buff but i'm also tired of doing frenzy. Let me pick the achtype i wanna play at least if the cards that gonna build it will be random after.\n\n2- [b] So far the unlockable companions seems very bad. [/b] I unlocked 4 so far but they all don't seem to add much to their archetypes, I might don't see their potential yet but in my runs i always find more use on the basic ones than the unlocked ones. Give them a little buff, they are achievements after all.\n\n3- [b] Loki's collar bell should jiggle when he moves/attack. [/b] This one is very necessary.\n\n4- [b] Explain specific interactions. [/b] Many you can experiment and learn but when you lose a good rng run bc you didn't know how something worked is very frustrating. RIP my 2 runs i lost bc counter attack triggers on the attacking unit only if it is in the same row of the defender. It is an interaction I had no way to know it worked like that and costed my runs against the tiger a few times.\n\n5- [b] For real it would be so cute if Loki's bell would jiggle when he moves. [/b] Think about it.......\n\nFew things are holding this game back from its full potential, and i would say i'm not completely against the idea of rng cards, but compared to other deck builders i wish we could have a bit more of control over what our deck gonna be. Leader is random, companions are randoms (besides pets), charms are randoms, make it so hard to have fun doing a massive bunny bomb deck for example. Overall, i'm loving the game and hope  to see it grow more <3",1

Each hero has different traits and with the ability to choose your starting ally.

136692584,1811990,"There have been a lot of card-based strategy games recently and I would rank Wildfrost as the best among the ones I've tried. The game is really polished compared to most releases these days, it has its own unique art style which is actually pretty great. The game is challenging and fun and the repetitive nature is curbed in a lot of ways. The dailies are great, the hero/item mixes keep it fresh. After 30+ hours I'm constantly kicking myself for forgetting how things will play out and losing for being dumb then immediately throwing another run together.\n\nMy critiques would be that it can be a bit repetitive despite all the combinations possible. In each run you are essentially doing the same thing over and over. A pro and a con is that your successful run becomes your opponent (on crack) next run. This is good because it teaches you how to counter certain strategies, ex smackback with freezing, buuuut it also motivates you to not make your heroes too good either which is a bit counter to the purpose of a game like this IMO.\n\nIf the developer is planning to continue to add to the game I think there is plenty of opportunity to expand on the game and help the critiques I've seen of price and repetitiveness. Having another adventure level to finish after the first (rather than ending your run) for example. Having a crafting service in town where you could spend unspent bling upgrading cards or something would be a way you could progress across runs. I'd like to see some more depth if an expansion/DLC is added. Another way to add depth would be more opponent types/base card deck combos. Maybe another epic daily of some sort or a pve tournament you could use saved up blings to enter and gain special crafting mats or blings from doing well in.\n\nI received this game for free, however, for transparency I typically rank games on pricing as \""good\"" at $1/hr of entertainment and \""great\"" at $0.50/hr from a pricing standpoint. As I'm writing this review I'm almost at 40 hours (some idle) so it fits between the good to great from a pricing perspective for me.\n\nIf you like card based strategy games I highly recommend Wildfrost. Thanks for a fun game!",1
136692294,1811990,"Is Wildfrost a good game? Yes.\n\nWith that out of the way, I do have to question what type of audience the Wildfrost devs thought this cutesy \""card battler\"" game with a deceptively sleek interface would attract. Because Wildfrost is a game that is, down to its bones, rooted in a kind of game design that we don't see an excess of. Much like the winter climes its setting inhabits, and similar to games like Library of Ruina, Rain World, or (dare I say it) Dark Souls, Wildfrost cares not for the player. It places a mountain in front of you, then asks if you can climb it. The game, fundamentally, is about personally triumphing against the odds.\n\nObviously, this isn't for everyone. But as someone who grew up with flash games like Mud and Blood, The Impossible Game, and countless infuriating point-and-click adventures, Wildfrost...isn't even that bad when it comes to its unfairness. It rewards considered play, smart play, but most importantly, it rewards consistent play. This is a game that demands your full attention at all times, as there are no \""stockpiling\"" mechanics. You do not have a large but depleting health pool like in Slay the Spire; you are at death's door at every moment. But generally, there will always be a way out (with some exceptions). I understand how this can be frustrating to those coming to this game imagining something more relaxed (a completely fair assumption), but this also drives a constant tension. No matter how good your team, one wrong move and you will be sent back to the start.\n\nUltimately, I think Wildfrost falls victim not to any particular sin in its gameplay, but in how it presents to consumer expectations. If the aesthetic here was replaced with a grimdark setting and a boxy, uninviting user interface, I'd hazard a guess the ratings would at least be Very Positive. Alas, it inhabits an aesthetic space which its gameplay does not correspond to. \n\nHowever, let this not be absolution for all this game's sins, for there are also some game design choices which genuinely seem poorly conceived. In no particular order: the fact that heroes cannot interact with the core evasive mechanic of the game could probably be remedied (perhaps cost a turn to recall your hero, cost another to play them, require them to be played immediately upon draw, and lose if all other units have been killed?); certain mechanics (i'm looking at you bones) have far fewer solutions than others, leading to unavoidable deaths; heroes in general are just a bit problematic in this game (and I suspect for one reason or another some of the design iteration occurred without factoring them in) not just due to their fragility but also their lack of strong synergistic mechanics; and highly varying power levels amongst all aspects of the game, even considering synergies.\n\nStill, these are not game-breaking flaws in the least, and in their own way add a bit of charm to the game (except the heroes being bland as dirt), though I do hope that the developers are willing to take on the advice of the players to some extent when it comes to at least remedying some of the most unavoidable game overs. \n\nIn short, Wildfrost is not for everyone. But if you want a game with serious strategic depth, where optimal lines are often unclear and yet vital to your survival, and unfairness is just another rock to climb, it's certainly worth a purchase.\n\n designed for the type of gamer willing to approach a sheer cliff of\n\nDon't let the g\n\n\nIs this game impossibly hard?

Add in all sorts of negative events, 2 layerd maps and more.  If this sounds fun to you then this is probably what you are looking for.

It also runs maxed out butter smooth as well, which is great!\n\nAudio: Really cool audio here with the sound effects on guns, space and explosions in space distance, really happy with this!\n\nControls: Super easy to rebind the keys and get going, confusing to figure out which way you are going.\n\nGame-play and everything else after: So the game is a small shooter arena based shooter, there are teams of 5v5 in space with a variety of modes to choose from.\n\nSome modes are more fun then others but for myself, I keep them all set because it's a change of pace compared to doing one mode only every time, so it's different and fun.\n\nAs I write this review, there is a currency but no store? So not sure what is up with that but it's EA so not expecting a lot.\n\nThere is a decent amount of characters to choose from, which all have their own abilities and style towards the teamwork (IE, Medics, mechanics, soldier etc etc)\nEach character has a max amount of equipment you can use, kind of like a build with limited numbers otherwise you float around with max stuff.\n\nThere are some amazing skins to choose from and visually they are really nice to look at.\n\nKilling players is satisfying as well the way the streaks pop up like a badge. Some people say it's like COD but I do not think so.\n\nYou can choose your region but at the moment but to EA, there does some to be some syncing issues with some players flying around, one tapping people and it's very suspect for cheating which again brings the fact right now, we cannot report those people which sucks.\n\nWeapons, guns, character control all feels great and the ability to stand out with a shiny skin floating through space shooting is great. \n\nThere are little things like floating to far out and meteor debree kills you or shooting the glass and even airlocks have some cool effects, which all does make a great game!\n\nWould I recommend this game? 100% a great shooter and something different on the market.

136690641,1364020,"Ill try keeping this review updated. Also english is not my first language, dont be too harsh.\n\nGraphics: \nThe game look really good, they nailed the feeling of just floating in space. The lighting is in almost all cases on point and the gun and map visuals look realistic and believable. There is some slight map destruction (solar panels etc.)  wich fits the gameplay and the enviromente overall. All in all stunning visuals of the space and the space stations.\n\nGunplay:\nThe guns feel like you expect it, compareable to the CoD 2019 gunplay. There is a good amount of weapons, reaching from assault rifles to shotguns and snipers. All of them are customizable, also pretty similar to CoD. There is a big ammount of unlockable skins, some are ugly as hell, some look really cool. \nIn almost all my games, the snipers dominated. They feel pretty good but its a bit to easy to easy to hit, this should be changed. Also assault rifles and submachine guns are pretty much useless on bigger maps but all in all, the gun balancing and feeling are decent. The game has 5 classes with their own weapons and abilities, none of them is overpowerd and they add ome depth to the gameplay.\n\nMovement:\nIs the best factor of the game, the movement is easy to learn and opens much options for flanking and other tactics. The maps are build for the movement. You turn arround and the map changed compleetly (If that makes sense...), I would go so far and say, alone for the unique movement you should try this game. The addet grappling hook keeps the movement more exciting and just overall fluid and good.\n\nSound:\nThe sound is minimalistic, not much music, just you your gun and the endless space. Guns sound muffeld but still punchy, the few explosions sound also good. All in all good sounddesign but I would listen to some music while playing.\n\nProblems:\nAs stated in many other reviews, there is a problem with high ping players in your game. They lagg around so you cant hit them while they kill you sometimes behind walls etc. \nAnother problem are the spawns, there are no fixed spawns but the spawnpoints are always close together and nothing stops you to just fly in the enemy spawn area and kill them. A spawnprotection could fix this or compleetly random spawns.\nThe translation of the game in in some menues still in chinese bit this will be fixed soon.\nThe visuals of the \""jetpacks\"" look not good and a bit buggy.\n\nConclusion:\nI have to say I have a pretty good time playing this game, its fun, the movement is easy to learn but hard to master, the guns are fun and you can unlock lots of stuff. The visuals are my favourite, it look stunning. Sound, visuals and gunplay go hand in hand and fit perfect together. The developers made a perfect foundation for cool weapons and maps and i believe this game has a lot of potential.\n\n",1

The frustration index is at or near the maximum, though: enemies will spawn practically inside of you, already attacking, and every enemy will hit for near half your health, while your heals are especially piddly. The second boss is also very rough; this is very much a git gud style of game, as opposed to Souls or Bloodborne, because while there are upgrades they are not numerous and extremely expensive, at least so far. Another big quibble: a lot of the environments feature color on slightly darker version of the same color, which makes them very difficult to read.\n\nBut the aesthetic is wonderful, the plot is intriguing, and the game does have Big Souls vibes, if you enjoy mastering very difficult challenges.",1

Between runs you also get bits of lore which got me curious about the story.\nThe game runs very smoothly, seems well optimized.

Upgrading your squad is something you are constantly thinking about as you edge ever so close to the bunker (camping portion of the game). There is alot going on and you have to pay attention to every detail to build this group of hero's. I am having alot of fun playing and this Dev has done an excellent job. I have not wiped yet which is a concern of mine (hopefully the dev will address this ASAP for people that feel the same way as me). The zone's can take over an hour to finish and there are 3 diffrent areas with about 8  to 10 diffrent zones to complete. If you wipe (there is no way to scum save either that I have found anyway) and your in the second area with the 1st area complete you are already 10 hours plus into the game and you still have 2 areas (16 to 20 zones) to complete, which I dont think alot of people are gonna wipe and restart after putting all that time into the run. I think the dev should take this into consideration instead of just saying this is a rougelite take it or leave it. If people are to keep playing this game this needs to be addressed imo. Overall the price tag is so low that I thought I was signing up for welfare when I made the purchase (joking).

The gun play is just SO satisfying, every gun feels like a hot chunky piece of death, most* of the enemies are fun and unique to fight, AND probably my favorite part so far, every level (that I've played, only on level 4) has completely new scenery and flow to it. \n\nOne point you're going down claustorphobic (sp) hallways dodging and weaving with your shotgun, next you're fighting in a big junkyard with rusting hulks scattered around in a combination of multiple height levels with threat priority being vital to a small arena with negligible movement allowed trying to output as much dmg as possible. \n\nPlus it's got a pretty killer sound track.\n\n*In hard mode the suicide bombers can make a few areas feel kind of cheap, but I did eventually find out that double jumping helps A LOT to mitigate their damage, but sometimes it still is a bit overwhelming.",1

136693767,1798010,"I want to preface this review by saying that it applies to both Vol. 1 and Vol. 2. \n\nI discovered MMBN when I was 8 years old. Since then, I have played each game to death over and over. I have collected the physical battle chips, I own the PET toys, I have a few eReader cards, and I have watched the anime more times than I can count. Saying I am a *mega* fan of BN is quite the understatement.\n\nThat being said, there is only ONE (1) single stain on an otherwise nearly perfect product that could be fixed: that god. damn. font. OH BOY I cannot wait for a mod to fix the \""\""HD\""\"" font and return it to a pixel style. It looks so damn out of place, and it's not even used consistently. Please Capcom,I beg of you to please give us an option to have the original font!\n\nOutside of that single gripe, the amount of love and care that went into crafting and celebrating these quite obscure games in an otherwise highly acclaimed series is phenomenal. I can tell that the creators truly cared about giving a definitive way to experience the games for fans and new players alike. It has so many fully-realized features that would otherwise be a pipe dream. The localization of the Boktai crossover, unobtainable chips, and the eReader functionality has been restored! Lastly, the final cherry on top has to be the online play. Competitive BN has been around for quite some time, and although I have yet to dabble into it, these games give me more than enough reasons to do so.\n\nOverall, I HIGHLY recommend these games. If you're new, the best three to experience are easily 3, 5, and 6, as they have the best combat and stories.\n\n9.9999/10",1
136693399,1798010,Great! Would recommend for nostalgia sake alone.,1

136693114,2329130,"Overall it was pretty good. The game's greatest feature definitely is the design of the first two areas namely the city and the video store. The video store has the be the best I've ever seen in a game yet. It looks very authentic. Its worst feature has to be the sewer level. Indeed, there is a sewer level in this game and it's such a pain to get through. Basically there's this maze in the sewer where you need to flip 5 switches while getting chased the whole time. Also the chase music during this segment, which was a silly-ass hard rock track, really did not help it. Speaking of the soundtrack, the atmospheric themes were great but all the action themes sounded completely ill-fitted to me. The latter were all comprised of butt-rock and metal tracks.",1

136690014,1574830,"So far I've played the tutorial and a standard game and the experience has been incredibly solid, it feels like a mix of Age Of Mythology and a Hands off colony sim, with the choices you make in the world being the driving force of how your empire progresses, and so far it's pretty fun..\n\nAlthough there were a few issues I noticed in my limited playtime; \n\n- The tutorial asks you to collect enough wood to build a certain item, but there's no indication of how much you've collected, how much is needed for the item, and how much each resource gives!\n\n- Setting a commandment for my warriors to attack enemies seemed to have no effect, which obviously isn't very helpful when the enemy foxes are steamrolling their way to victory\n\n- Audio sliders didn't really seem to have any effect, zooming in on a unit chopping a tree for example is deafening.\n\n- Having to wait to timeout of placing an item, seems like a design decision but it's just frustrating\n\n\nDon't let the above issues hold you back from trying the game, it's a cohesive experience and feels like a refreshing take on the colony / empire genre, and once they're solved, it'll be an even smoother experience.

136697704,1811990,"I have to make this review as I absolutely adore this game and can't stand a great indie game I love having mixed reviews when it deserves better. First off I want to adress the elephant in the room: Yes, the game has a relatively high skill floor ergo going into this game you will fail a lot to little mistakes. BUT you will learn of them and become better quickly and I wouldn't say the game is more difficult than Slay the Spire just a bit more complex as you have to juggle characters and their cooldowns. This game is a little like a puzzle, maybe comparable to Into the Breach, and when you like more in-depth tactical gameplay, this will hit the spot! I am a total noob gamer, play everything at Normal, mostly even on Easy difficulty. I don't have any prowess in tactical RPGs.\n\nI still won my first run after 5-6 hours. 5-6 hours I spent being frustrated from time to time, but also being entertained A LOT! I haven't felt this kind of wonder since Slay the Spire. I took breaks in between and came back stronger. I won my 2nd run after round about 16 hours this time even on the higher difficulty which is unlocked after the first win, again having a lot of fun learning all the mechanics, the bosses, the enemies and their moves. Remember: I AM A CASUAL GAMER. And I still made it. So you can do it, when these games are up your alley and you love intense tactical RPG card combat systems. The battles are intense, but also highly fun.\n\nThe game scratches the Slay the Spire itch SO MUCH. There are a lot of card battler rogue lites nowadays and none other than Wildfrost and Slay the Spire hit the spot for me as perfectly as they did, even though I did try a lot of them. But Wildfrost also does apply its own spin on these with a lot of tactical depth, charming characters and soooo many mechanics that can mix and match perfectly. Yes, you can go for a build that focuses mainly on one mechanic. But I tried that a lot of times and I was actually more successfull with builds that featured 2-3 or even more mechanics.\n\nThe only point I love to loathe about the game: You are highly dependent on RNG. Sometimes I will end up with a useless leader. Or a leader that has no synergy with the first 1-2 travelers I meet. Which make the early stages especially hard to get a decent run going. This can be viewed as a plus point, because you are forced to go out of your comfort zone and have to try out builds, you never thought to try, but also being forced can feel restricting and mean. I don't mind it too much, so it is no dealbreaker for me.\n\nAlso the meta progression feels sometimes a little punishing, because some unlockables aren't really that good. It would be nice if there would be a menu to turn specific unlockables off, because they water down the pool of available cards and as the game is pretty dependent on RNG as it is, it makes you having the build you want even harder to pull off.\n\nAll in all I love this game. I already played it a lot these past few days. I loved the Demo on the Switch, I purchased it on both, Steam and Switch and use those games together with my partner and we are both having a blast playing Wildfrost. \u2665",1
136697644,1811990,Game is amazing and surprisingly fair. Most of my runs end due to me making a mistake that could very much of been avoided if I was less dumb. \n\n,1
136697487,1811990,"I saw the negative complaints about difficulty and thought okay maybe people are exaggerating. They aren't. I have no trouble consistently winning in Monster Train or Slay the Spire, this game's direct competitors. This game is wildly unbalanced. Everything else about it is really cool but you basically have to get lucky to win, the numbers are all way out of wack starting with the second chapter or whatever.",0
136697467,1811990,"I'm writing my review to only focus on one thing. The difficulty. I expected something very bad. But what I found was after a few games of learning how Wildfrost works I found the game isn't all that difficult. People said it has a long unlock curve but compared to a game like Across the Obelisk that's not true.\n\nThe game requires you to learn how Wildfrost plays differently from other games to learn the gameplay loop. Games are quick. Bad luck can happen with card/ally selections. But this means that you spend 15minutes and restart which isn't bad.\n\nI worry about the game getting too easy based on what the primary amount of users seem to want it to be. But if you're playing the game now, stick with it. Learn how the gameplay works. Unlock some more things and stick with it.",1

The owner was all pissy and grumpy because she was a refugee and he was a jerk, so I threatened him to shut him up. He called the law on me. The guard patrols chased me into the mountains and tried to arrest my group. Instead they all blamed it on the horse who was promptly thrown in jail.\n\n10/10. Would recommend.",1

It's like ugly and doesn't feel right\n- There are some odd choices of traits and flaws... An alcoholic horse? Wth?\n- Graphics are meh\n\nBut anyways...

Those who played Shattered Horizon back in the day can appreciate this game as it feels like a spiritual successor to it in some sense. I love the fast paced gunplay, quick reflex action and the fluidity of the game's overall look and feel.\n\nI have a few gripes that I will list below as things I'd love to see improve/change:\n- A better way to customize loadouts so that we're not having to go to a special page to do that, instead allow us to do kit modifications from the loadout screen during the game.\n- Please please consider Geo-Locking some or all the servers as the ability for a high ping player to join a server can really have detrimental effects on the overall match. No one wants to play against laggy peeps.\n- More visibility to the loadout/kits of the people you're playing against. It would be nice to know what I got killed by, the gun name, attachments, loadout, etc.\n- More maps, and dare I say, allowing folks to create custom maps via the workshop.\n- Ability to mute, votekick/voteban people in a match\n- Dedicated servers or some form of self-hosting with some parameters\n\nI hope this game continues to improve as I think it has a lot of potential and I look forward to continuing playing it as it matures.",1
136698576,1364020,"It's like playing Hardspace : Shipbreaker but you blow other people up instead of your salvage.\n\nThere's a learning curve for some aspect of the gameplay. Movement, shooting and getting shot in a 3D environment, target identification and understanding audio cues. But once you get used to it, the game really comes together and offer a breath of fresh vacuum in a market saturated with uninspired rehashed games.\nGameplay is solid and even though it's Early Access, i'm amazed at how well optimised it is. Running a game at high settings at 190 fps on my gtx 1080 in 2023.\nI really love the feel of shooting with the muffled sounds that travel through your suit and all the attention that went into the animations.\n\nSound design is top notch. I just can't get enough of the small details in the sound like that of the recoil spring that lingers after you've racked the bolt of the TK47. I suppose being in a vacuum would make you notice more the small contacts and vibrations against your suit.\n\nEverything is meticulously modelled to give a convincing near future feel to the game. The fact that they were able to make functioning props of their guns shows how the designs were made with real world constraints in mind. The game is beyond gorgeous and really hit the right notes in term of sci-fi for me\n\nHope this game does well",1

Further Bag/Storage upgrades included, their base, of course, something you could not even call small. \nYet the worst is the energy system.

The reason I am leaving a negative review is because the game brings nothing new to the table. It is becoming a negative trope that a medieval-style, banished-inspired, city builder is: place house, place road, place farm, place woodcutter, place stone quarry, etc... until a messy grid of said buildings occur. I just found myself becoming bored, very quickly, because I have done all of this before in games of the same genre. The few mechanics which are unique, such as the world map, are not well-developed (yet). The diplomacy is shallow and adds very little. The resource management is generic. The \""hero\"" feels like something out of clash of clans or a cheap mobile game.\n\nThe game is well executed but just uninteresting. I am looking forward to other projects in this genre, such as Manor Lords and Going Medieval, a lot more because those projects try to bring more uniqueness to their mechanics and gameplay in a genre which is already inflated with generic, Banished-inspired, grid-based, city builders.",0

It is a very cozy, cute city builder with a little romance. The soundtrack is great, too.\n\nGameplay-wise: The core mechanics are easy to understand, and the city building is fun. The game certainly has a learning curve regarding how to strategically set up storage etc. I will place a bunch of buildings differently in my next playthrough.\n\nHowever, since the game is in early access, a bunch of features aren't available yet. After finishing the \""early game\"" and moving on into the town era, the pacing felt very off in my opinion. The hero character also currently feels fairly arbitrary. Obviously the game has just been released and isn't fully developed, so I hope some balancing changes will be  made. (I was just watching youtube while waiting to accumulate more money, having built lots of homesteads and having neither the territory nor the money to build town housing.) In addition to balancing, a feature I would enjoy is to control my supply of wood and stone versus what gets turned into other building materials. I really dislike not having any stone because it all got used up... This being said, this is all criticism on a very high level.\n\nOverall, this Fabledom is a wonderful game.

136697580,2329130,"[url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KRHNe4B8yY] Click Here To Watch My Experience With This Game [/url]\n\nI'll start with the CONS:\n\n[Interaction Issue]\nThere are certain objects you can interact with and have no issues but then are others in which you need to be incredibly accurate to do so. For example, there is a section in the sewer in which you need to insert a key into a 'box' in order to retrieve the item inside of it. If you aren't looking directly at the keyhole, you won't be allowed to interact with it and you'll assume that you need to do something else (at least, I did). This might not seem like a big issue but the area is huge and you're being chased constantly so the repetitive chase music and the frustration of having to look everywhere and believing you might have missed something is very real.\n\n[Puzzles]\nAs for the puzzles in this game, they're incredibly easy and I honestly wouldn't even consider them puzzles. The only puzzle that should require thought, does not allow you to make mistakes. If a piece is where it needs to be, it will tell you it's correct. This means you can shuffle the pieces around without thinking about it and it'll auto-solve itself. \n\n[Music]\nI mentioned it already, but the repetitive music is very, very bad. Even if you solve the sewer section quickly, the odds are that you will hear the chase music too many times. At a certain point, any fear or tension is replaced with eye-rolls and frustration. It's not like he can really catch you anyway. I was only hit twice in my entire playthrough and that's because I stopped caring about my own safety after 40 minutes of trying to find a key item. \n\nHere are the PROS:\n\n[Graphics]\nThis game looks fantastic. There's a ton of detail in every area and no shortage of viscera and other gross things. If you're into this aesthetic, I'd argue that this is probably the best looking game within this style. \n\n[Voice Acting]\nThere is Voice Acting in this game, so you don't have to worry about reading every single thing. This is especially great news because my voice has been recovering lately so I'm happy to see it. Is the acting very good? Not really but I don't think it's meant to be. The voices are obviously from friends or online acquaintances so it's cool. I have no idea where the accents are from and I'm happy with never knowing.\n\n[Gameplay]\nThe Gameplay is flawless. There is a very high level of polish here. No bugs, no crashes, no issues. There isn't anything particularly unique about the mechanics or anything. It's your standard indie horror game stuff. Crouch, walk, or run to find stuff and open doors to escape.\n\n[Story]\nThe story is a story. If you're looking for a narrative with clever writing, subtle characters, and sophisticated twists, this isn't it. It's a guy in a pig mask killing people and you happen to be one of the victims. \n\n[Overall Opinion]\nI think it's fine. I'm not sure about paying $12 for this though. It's probably better to wait for a sale and get it at half price. \n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KRHNe4B8yY",1

136700102,2109430,"This is a short and sweet compact visual novel with a single puzzle element to it set in the Tron Universe. It's an original story that fleshes out the world into a few ways we haven't seen and I really liked it. This is my second type of game like this, Citizen Sleeper being the first. It's not nearly as comprehensive as CS, but the writing and decisions with weight are there. This is a game for kids who grew up on Choose Your Own Adventure books didn't know they needed. \n\nThe most common complaint is that it's too short, most likely is because for those of us who are fans of Tron, we'd always love to see more. Especially stories of substance. The music feels like it belongs in this world without being a discount daft punk. The art direction is amazing to absorb.  The actual story here is crisp and concise, there's not a lot of fluff, which leads to the short run-time. And by short, I completed two and a half runs in just under 5 hours. I think if it was lacking anything it would be a bit more meat on the resolution, so that the inciting incident that kicks off the game is a bit easier to wrap my head around. \n\nIf you are an existing fan, your going to love this take. I really hope they have plans for expansions soon, because they've setup plenty to fill out more stories here.",1

136702578,1811990,"Incredible card game. Art style, music, gamefeel all impeccable. Definitely on the hard side of card games though, which is a good thing imo. For the love of the universe don't read the bad reviews, it's mostly from people who don't like/can't handle difficulty.",1
136702532,1811990,"This game is INCREDIBLE! \nGorgeous art style, super fun concepts, a plethora of combos you can pull off, and great replayability.\nThe game DOES require a bit of thinking, planning, and adaptability. And it IS difficult. But it's NOT unfair.\nThe base difficulty (without modification bells) is a joke tbh. Obviously, you can't slap together random cards and expect to win every run, but it's pretty easy once you get the hang of the mechanics. \nWith optional added difficulty, as the enemies scale, so do you. The bells give extra money, more card options, and a crown, so you can pull off insane combos. \nAdditionally, the devs have already communicated that they'll work on making it more accessible (adding some kind of easy mode I guess, scaling down enemy HP and attack would be my assumption).\nThere's also the fact that there are so many hidden little interactions for you to discover. For example, one character has a snowball above his head which grows (visually) as his attack increases. \nAbsolutely adore this game, and would recommend it to anyone who likes roguelikes and deck builders. \n\nTL;DR The game is difficult, but not unfair. Devs are already looking into adding some kind of mode with lower difficulty for all the wimps out there. If you can actually read the cards and don't mind being challenged, the game is actually a MUST-PLAY for all roguelike/deckbuilding fans.",1
136702194,1811990,"The game is decently balanced. I have studied game design, so I know what I am talking about. I beat the game in my first four runs. And that is despite the fact that I made misplays. Heck, I have even beaten the frost guardian with oil. In case you do not know, oil removes abilities. Meaning I had to punch through 999 HP. I did find some bugs, like having recycle 0 on a unit still requires a junk card in hand, and the junk card becomes consumed. In my opinion, this game is charming and satisfactory. This game is like Monster Train, in the sense that you can build some insane combos. I am 100% sure you can beat the first fight as long as you play strategically. I am looking forward to completing the rest of the achievements.",1
136702122,1811990,"Very fun, keep up the good work!",1
136701796,1811990,"Before I begin my review, I must say that I duly recommend this game, though there are some mechanical flaws here and there and the tutorial for some things could be better (like I for example did not get that mushrooms hit for their full value every turn they are applied, which led to a couple failed runs in the beginning before I understood the mushroom number is not simply a timer of how many turns, but also how much damage it hits for every turn), it is overall very well made and I think a lot of peoples issues with the game come more from a general lack of proper communication of strategies, general ideas of how the game is supposed to be played as well as some other general misassumptions people make.\n\nI think understanding a few general strategies (which in my case were obvious since I came from Inscryption Kaycees mod, which can also be brutally unforgiving in the higher levels, as one bad play can kill your run and uses some of the very same techniques of withholding your own characters powers when necessary) can really improve your user experience with this game, so I will give some detail regarding this below.\n\nGeneral strategies: You have to approach this game like a high stakes puzzle game. It is not simply wise to attack with everything whenever possible. I think many people make the missassumption damage = good and therefore do not pull back characters into their deck when they would hit something that has a terrible trigger effect when approached. Often it is not even wise to pull back characters from the field entirely and simply getting them out of the wrong lane can help, as then their turn timer will continue ticking down. This doesn't mean however that one should not try to get good damage in whenever possible, as certain enemies must simply be taken out immediately.\n\nAbuse the absolute hell out of abilities, I mean it. Choose a type of synergy and stick with it, there are most often ways to break the game, even when your draws haven't been super amazing. Keep your deck as trim as necessary and do not overload on allies.\n\nOne of the largest parts of the game is knowing how to prioritize properly. You basically need to create a strict hierarchy of  which actions to undertake, how to stack your field, as well as which enemies to apply to with which cards when. If a turn takes 5 min, it takes 5 min. I watched RTgame play this game and he had a couple of serious misplays because he was interacting with the stream as an entertainer more than focussing on the game (which I absolutely get if you're a streamer), but this may generate a lot of frustration when approaching this game from the wrong angle. When do you reroll your hand? What is in your deck? Which enemy do you attack with which effect? The game in this sense is more like a chess game than something you can just casually wing, which is where I think a lot of the frustration for players comes from. If you do not enjoy chess (in this case mixed with some draw probability), you will not enjoy this game. I think some of the aesthetics of the game give off this vibe of a general RPG game, which makes people fall into long formed habits when approaching their playstyle whereas it should be approached more like a puzzle rather than a \""turn based RPG\"". In turn based RPGs it is generally not necessary to hold or pull back characters, or apply some other weird mechanics like in this game.\n\nAlways bring freeze: to stack freeze and mushroom to make enemy characters fail their special reactions and get high damage in is absolutely crucial, as well as keeping your deck trim to always draw well. Abuse the absolute hell out of things like the sunshine rod or whatever it was called that ticks down your characters timers more quickly and stack characters with broken effects. Basically think: How can I play this the most unfair way possible, always freeze everyone, create broken playstyles and keep your chessboard tactics going.\n\nTo some degree I agree with the many criticisms, there could be a few RNG fixes here and there and maybe a slightly more beginner friendly intro/playstyle for people who aren't yet suited to high stakes card games where every turn counts, but overall I think I get the devs, I just think they need to improve User Experience by communicating better.",1
136701574,1811990,"This game is a gem. Gorgeous art, wonderful music, super unique gameplay that mixes a cool take on auto battling with more traditional deck builder structure, I personally love the lack of continuous HP throughout a run (every single battle is life or death).\n\nI don't want to sound like I'm some incredible gamer but I honestly do not see the balance complaints being accurate almost at all. The game is very very punishing, yes, but I've not yet found a circumstance where a run felt entirely unwinnable (I've done 13 run so far, winning 3 of them, literally every loss was me miscounting or misunderstanding some edge case, maybe one or two to bad luck of the draw [but it's a deck builder, come on]).\n\nThe end boss mechanic is the only thing I'm not totally in love with from a gut reaction, but it also hasn't been an issue for me at all yet.\n\nI do hope the devs make some changes for a softer difficulty curve so people who more casually enjoy these kinds of games can find the fun with it. But I very much recommend this to any Monster Train or Slay the Spire vets looking for a new experience.",1

I also noticed that despite hiding (before he sees you) he has a tendency to just stop and stare at the area you are hiding in infinitely until you enter his line of site and then he resumes chase.\nI struggled a little bit with the box needed to open the generator room, it was a bit hard to get the game to recognize I was trying to use an item, but I think that was partially to do with my own input mistakes as well.\n\nThese small hiccups do not deduct from the game for me at all, I would absolutely play it again and highly recommend it to fans of the genre!\n\nThis is the 1st game ive gone out of my way to 100% on achievements. I highly recommend replaying to see what you have missed, cos some of the extra bits are crazy!\n\nIt was an absolute pleasure to experience this game and im so excited to see whats to come from Comp & co in the future! Thank you for your hard work!\n\n",1

(yes I did the tutorial). 95% of the time I'm dead in spectator mode... which I cant even learn from and enjoy because I cant see the enemy team when I'm dead, so... It's fucking boring as fuck. Most of the player base doesn't have microphones so it's usually me and another noob asking eachother wtf is going on. idk. I'm sure it's a great game if you are good at it. But I'm not so... \nMaybe don't make enemies invisible when you are dead so you at least have something to watch while you can't even play.

Oh, and there is no tutorial, it tosses you in right away. Sink or swim.\n\nThe game's developer was friendly, and responded well to feedback.

136701139,1396190,This one is tricky. It has a nice artstyle and the story is neat so far if a bit basic. \nBut the controls feel a bit too floaty and imprecise for what's supposed to be primarily a platformer. \nAdditionally there are a couple annoyances like the unnecessary shaky-cam in some cutscenes. The camera in general feels slightly off. Like it switches it's movement speed very abruptly.\nIn one mission i had to get 3 ores in a mine but i assumed i would have to manually leave afterwards so i didn't check out a secret i had noticed. But the game dragged me out once i got the 3rd item and i couldn't go back.\n\nOverall i still recommend it but it could definitely use another polishing pass,1

136721040,1117160,"I have played this game on and off for sometime now, and for the work Omnem does in their explanation of ideas is pretty neat. The concept is interesting, but some bits of the execution could be done better.\n\nTo begin, I don't think the game is polished enough to justify a RM 50 cost. It still has some bugs. Omnem does fix them quickly though once reported, so it should fine given time. Single Player is fun for a bit, but it runs into some issues. Karmic Years do not decay and the amount you get from getting sieged is basically none(2 common years,really), making ai allies requires prefect ideological alignment(may get fixed when crises update comes out), and some stats like accident related deaths aren't really clear on what they do. Influence gain is way too slow for rapid expansion, even on the most forgiving settings, and it can be hard to find resources needed all the way to late game.\nAt least karmic years can be fully disabled in SP. That said, there are a few suggestions I would like to give.\n\nA general resource mapmode filtered to a player specified resource as well as on nations for trade would reduce frustration on finding goods wanted by players.\nAllow players to set up their own lobbies with custom settings, and add some additional settings, like guaranteed resources and karmic year decay over long periods of peace or after a set amount of time.\nClear up some stats on what they do exactly.\nAdd some way to increase influence gain, both in game and in pre game settings.\nMake the ai easier to ally via multiple methods.\n\nThe game can be played with a fixed set and a randomized set. The former is good for understanding the views of the author and can be metagamed, but the sp victory requirements that scale with time suggests that the latter is the intended set. This is fine, a small adjustment for the fixed set or even sliders would be nice though.\n\nThe game does have a charm of sorts despite its flaws. I enjoyed reading all the flavor text as well as the events, and finding ways to break the game is enjoyable. Omnem does a pretty good job on expressing them self within the dialog and has heart put into it.\n\nI would carefully recommend the game, but be might not be for you if reading isn't a thing you like to do. \n\nTLDR: Has heart, but still lacks polish. Good if you want to read and have time, otherwise buy something else instead.",1

Not just due to the movement techniques you can use to travel around as fast as possible, but also due to how many different options there are available at the player's disposal to progress through the game. The sequence-breaking capabilities are particularily fun to discover.\n\nFor instance, you might think that in order to open a door with 4 locks on it, you'd need to defeat 4 bosses so that you can get 4 keys. However, you could also just find the rocket launcher and literally propel yourself above the aforementioned door, skipping it altogether.

136722872,1811990,"Wildfrost is really ridiculously underrated at time of writing, probably the furthest I've seen a recommended percentage from my actual enjoyment of something on this platform. Difficult turn based strategy games, especially card and board ones, are a secure favorite genre of mine. I completely acknowledge that I could not be any more biased. If you asked me prior to playing this to describe the perfect game to get my attention, I wouldn't have come up with something this good. The visuals and game-play are the strongest delivery to this genre I have seen in some time, it's really something. \n\nThe game is very hard, but the daunting part about the difficulty curve is less the peaks and more the consistent height. It starts quite hard while you get the first couple unlocks, it stays quite hard as you learn the mechanics, and presents new challenges every step after to remain, well, hard. There is very minimal tutorializing, no handicaps for repeat losses, and never a safe encounter. That is probably what caused people to be so thrown off and assume there is some crippling rng problem. It's best to think about it like an old arcade game, once you get the hang of things its very enjoyable but a bit scary at a first glance. \n\nSkill agency is through the roof, there is an amount of rolling baked in like every entry to this genre but you have so many choices in a turn. Opening hand size is huge making you less draw reliant, enemies broadcast every move they make forever, and every permanent card you place can be shuffled to any space on your board in a turn. Every step has been taken to reward you as much as possible learning. Getting better is extremely achievable should you be willing to invest the time to do it. I thinks its fair to not want to do that, it probably isn't a game for absolutely everyone, especially strategy newcomers. But if you are willing to commit to it I assure you it will be time well spent",1

I've seen people think that the game removes junk mobs from other games to streamline the process. I'm sorry to say that the current design makes many cards waste, because you can only choose certain cards to defeat the stronger old myself.\nI can try many strange or weak combos in other games and win just for fun, But I can't do this here.",0

I personally would suggest just ignoring all the reviews and give this game a chance. The graphics and card designs are all very charming and the variety of leaders the game provides makes each run interesting and fresh. \n\nPersonally I think people got into the game assuming it will be very easy due to the ascetics, but that is definately not the mindset you should have when playing this game. Wildfrost is extremely challenging, but provides the mechanics and variety to make your victories feel that much more rewarding. \n\nIn conclusion, whatever the other people said about the game being bad is complete bs, and this game certainly deserves more than just a mixed score.

It's a missed opportunity, as the premise could have been used to create a more nuanced and engaging experience. The graphics are subpar, and the sound design is grating and unimmersive.\n\nThe story is also severely lacking, with a clich\u00e9d plot and two-dimensional characters. The lack of depth makes it difficult to feel any connection or empathy towards the protagonists or the people trapped in the hospital. Moreover, the game fails to provide any thought-provoking commentary on the state of mental healthcare, which could have been a redeeming aspect.\n\nIn conclusion, I cannot recommend the \""Psychiatric Hospital Horror Game\"" to anyone. It is a tasteless, uninspired, and glitchy game that adds nothing to the horror genre save your time and money for something else.",0

I'm an absolute sucker for the realistic space exploration art direction this has going on.\n\n26$ CAD is well worth the price of admission for what youre getting here. Fun gunplay, unique movement mechanics, great sound design that really does enhance your immersion (its almost relaxing at time) and the gorgeous visuals that run smooth. For reference: I was consistently getting 130 to 140 FPS with DLSS turned on with high graphics with my 3070Ti.\n\nSure at this stage there are a few bugs here and there. One menu is still in chinese (almost non problematic since sinces only for the update logs) and you'll get the odd typo once in a while but none of that has hindered my experience in my 10 hours of gameplay. I even played 3 to 4 hours party-ed up with some friends and we had a blast the whole time.\n\nPersonally this hits all the notes for me. \nI hope this game succeeds because its truly something special.\n\nAlso, regarding future development and support; The dev team seems very passionate about their game.

I just noticed something when I upgraded my passive skills. I recommend that maybe it's better if you can see the stats per level that can be obtained instead of only seeing them every time you upgrade, so the players can see how many max stats they can get by upgrading, and this is also a good idea to have the players have a strategy to manage what passive skills they need to increase in different characters.

Zudem gibt es diverse Ereignisse, die ab und an geschehen, und man kann sich mit anderen Herrschern anfreunden, was einem auch etwas bringt. Umso mehr ich die niedlichen Bewohner beobachtet habe, umso mehr musste ich an die ersten Siedlerspiele zur\u00fcckdenden, deren Wuselfaktor ich sehr geliebt habe. Ich w\u00fcrde dieses Spiel allen empfehlen, die niedliche Aufbauspiele wie beispielsweise Foundation - was mich etwas an dieses Spiel hier erinnert - m\u00f6gen.

Played the flat version back then on GamePass and hoped this might get VR. Now here we are and I like it. Controls still can feel a bit jank and glitching around when interacting with objects or the enviroment. Sometimes the sounds seem to cut off.

The vibe/feel of the store was exactly what I wanted and hoped I would get from the entire game, it left me wanting more of it. Like a \""Night Shift by puppet combo\"" type of game that took place at a video store. Have it nice and normal as the night starts then have it get more desolate and creepy as it gets later.

It\u00b4s what actually makes this game fun! The choices you make, the paths you take, the cards you upgrade, what you play, how you position your troops, it ALL IS VITAL and will change the outcome of your run! \n\nPeople want games with meaningful choices and strategy but once they make bad decisions, they call it too difficult. \n80% of my runs have failed because I made a dumb decision and the game punished me for it. This makes it super fun, though. With every run I\u00b4ve unlocked new things, keeping the content fresh! And with every dumb choice I make, I learn from my mistakes and get further in the next attempt.\n\nThe tribes you can play are incredibly varied and play very differently. \nHeroes, companions, charms and cards with a dozen varying effects make combos and strategies super fun and somewhat unique every run.\nThe progressive unlocking of cards, charms (card upgrades), companions keeps the incentive to re-run interesting and high.\n\nMy only complaint is that some effects are somewhat unclear and require testing to understand. A few of my runs were ruined by this issue. Part of the learning process but it would also just be easier if it was specified how certain effects affect results. Same thing with not being able to see if you\u00b4ve reached your companion limit. Other than that, all groovy!\n\nI can only recommend!!!",1
136735539,1811990,"After playing this game for 15 hours I feel I can give my honest opinion on it. This game reminds me a lot of Slay the Spire and The Darkest Dungeon, with how strategic you need to be and with some level of RNG that's involved. However, I will say this game looks and feels quite polished compared to the two, as it feels more fluid. The art style is quite nice to look at and the story/characters you come along as interesting as a whole. However, if I had one thing to say about this game to sum it up, it's that it's very very difficult. It took me a good few hours just to figure out a few mechanics that aren\u2019t told to you, and the learning curve is very steep for new players. I'm not a god at the game but if you take your time to figure out different combinations and paths you can take it's very rewarding. I would say that perhaps it is too harsh for newcomers to this type of game and the beginning can be more forgiving, however other than that I do enjoy this quite a bit, and I do believe everyone should give it a try at least once.\n",1

Some examples would be: 1. when it comes time to quit, the game will not stop running. Every time I have to kill Steam via task manager. I don't find this to be acceptable. 2. Fishing mini game is broke. As soon as you cast, your mouse cursor disappears and you can't play the mini game, so you just lose every time. And the list of bugs goes on... Nothing game breaking (for me at least) but annoying stuff.\n\nLast thing I would mention is everything is VERY SMALL. I don't sit with my face 8\"" from my monitor, so this is causing quite a bit of eye strain/fatigue. Just a warning to those who also don't sit on top of their monitors.

Anybody who has ever experienced pinball in VR is probably aware that it's a bummer going back to a flat screen where you just never get the perfect camera angle versus feeling like you are actually standing at a real 3D machine using your head naturally as the camera. If this feature isn't added by the developers, there is at least an upcoming mod being worked on that will make VR possible soon.\n\n4/5 Super addicting but needs some optimization and a little more love in some areas.

136741934,1811990,"The game really doesn't feel fair to play.\n\nI have a LOT of hours into Slay the Spire, Roguebook, and many other card games. It is entirely unbalanced, there's basically no point in withdrawing cards into the pouch to heal them, as there's zero chance you'll still be alive by the time you can use them again.\n\nYour start is entirely random, and you will outright lose almost every game based on the selection of leaders and misc crap you are then given.\n\nIn something like Slay the Spire, Roguebook, or Monster Train, if you lose MOST of the time it is due to a misplay, or not following through on a strategy. Occasionally or rarely it is due to bad luck. In this game, there's no way to (consistently) heal your character, and you get one of three choices of leaders, all of which are usually bad in my experience, they either do no damage, have aimless (which will mean when they DO attack they attack at random), or are just mediocre. If your leader dies the run ends. Enemies have very high HP, you will get to pick between 1-2 cards generally between fights, every fight has a boss, and depending on the RNG of what you draw at the start, you can lose pretty much from the get-go.\n\nFor example, I get no snowballs (the only way to delay enemy turns), no allies, and am fighting the monkey boss. One of the minor enemy monkeys has 8 hp, attacks every round, and gains 1 damage every round starting from zero. The problem? In my case it takes 4 turns for my character to attack for 4 damage, they have like 9 hp, in that timespan the monkey has hit me for 6 damage, and if I had no attack cards it is only at half hp, while i am down to 3 hp, with no consistent way to heal.\n\nKeep in mind there'll be another like 5 enemies that will spawn in during that time, and on the round I can attack, I'll be attacked by the boss, the monkey that is much stronger than the boss, and all the other misc. enemies.",0
136741301,1811990,This game is so great. I have played a lot of these kinda games and Wildfrost is definitely up there. It may need some overall balancing but the devs already adressed that in their latest blog post. I am certain this game will only get better. It is so much better than the mixed reviews seem to intend.,1
136740973,1811990,"This game is has a steep learning curve but it is great. It's charming and crushing at the same time but is so rewarding when you get a good handle on decision making in combat and on the map.\nYes it needs balance and I think some tuning to give the player more options out of bad RNG, but that's a staple of the rogue genre and when this game eventually strikes the right balance it will be amazing.",1

136742310,1527950,"This is a perfect example of a successful Early Access release. Back on launch, the game was pretty barren. The core systems were there, but there was little to do, it was buggy, unbalanced, and there were no tutorials, stuff just appeared on the screen and you had to guess what button the game wanted you to press. Nine updates later, and here we are, one of the most addicting games I've ever played.\n\nDuring Early Access, Shiro kept everyone in the loop with an updated roadmap that showed what updates were going to be released when, and then Shiro overdelivered on time, every time. I can't stress that part enough, they never missed a deadline. This game was always getting updates and those updates were GOOD.\n\nThis game was worth the money back then, and it is certainly worth your money now. I'm excited to see where they take it in the future.",1
136741832,1527950,"Very fun, would recommend to any DnD enjoyer. A good variety of characters you can play, loving the adaptive difficulty of enemies. Only criticism is that there isn't a main storyline to follow at the start, but otherwise very easy to get into and lose hours to playing it.",1

136739312,2328760,"This game is great. It has a huge selection of really good pinball tables available and uses the latest technology for enthusiasts that can make use of it (HDR, Raytracing, Cabinet Modes). It also has the best ball physics I know of on PC (and I have played almost every PC pinball game available within the last 30 years).\n\nI understand people who complain about the previous Epic Store exclusivity or the current pricing (the tables are more expensive than with FX3 and owners of the FX3 tables only get half-off the normal price) - but keep in mind that pinball is and always was a niche and probably will stay that. There simply aren't that many  potential buyers and the developers still need to earn a living. Zen definitely put hard work and some love into the product. If they would offer support for VR (the other small niche I love) in the future I would be grateful forever but even if not I am just happy that this game exists.",1
136741098,2267450,"Very cute, surreal, and amusing little game.

136740635,1651560,"So far the game has a strange hold on my brain. I love it. Its cutesy art style and relaxed approach to gameplay are refreshing. Its missing a lot of content right now, but that's only because its in Early Access, but what's here is currently very good. For someone who plays a lot of city builders, and played this game's demo extensively, there's a few hours of content. For a more casual audience I'd say there's easily double what I got.",1
136740497,1651560,"Cute is an understatement for this game. It still lacks features and content but thats somewhat okay i guess, since it's early access. It was fun playing this though and i have high hopes regarding the further development and the roadmap. Please don't disappoint me. Unpolished gem right now. Perfect for winding down though.",1
136740118,1651560,"There's a great foundation which also uses (foundation's) territorial system here but some stuff is lacking per say , pacing is tacky and some stuff is just weird.\n\nPro's - Unique systems and charming laid back art direction its super charming + relaxing. There's lots of potential here (hopefully it delivers)\n\nCon's - pacing is tacky - to put it mildly  the concept is there for food and gold etc. which are kinda basic , but the timing and cost of it encourages a super slow play style which might not be for everyone.\n\nDesirability - buildings have upkeep and certain heavier industries give or reduce desirability/beauty of a certain spot. Having high desirability increases happiness of the housing in the area- leading to a faster immigration rate i think at least) but really don't affect anything besides that so far.\n\nCost- The cost of buildings lends to its slow play style , buildings are pricey at the start and taxes are fixed, ie the initial farm of vegetables cost you 225 gold for the max of 40 fields, a single homestead for 3 peasants (2 workers) costs about 55 gold , with a ratio of 2-3 peasant houses giving enough cash to reach double digits + support the upkeep of one building that needs it.\n\n\nFood- It aint fully there yet, (fish comes in the future updates it says) + each food type gives its own number of food needs fulfilled . I.e wheat requires 2 processes to become bread - but has about double the food fulfillment compared to vegetables which don't need any processes to be used. The main problem is the ratio of the wheat products - you need 2 or 3 wheat units for one unit of flour, but 4 flour for 1 unit of bread, or just 4 units of wheat for pork (requiring a herd), this means essentially a super high scaling cost of a 1000 or more to get it to a stable supply for the next tier of citizens .\n\n",1

Now what we need to remember is this is a game that is in early access but that being said.... I sank 6 hours into this no problem. There is understandably quite a bit locked in game at the moment. Honestly though this runs super smooth, is peaceful and the mechanics aren't too hard to understand if you have played this type of game before. Yes the animations may seem a little \""childish\"" but for me this added a lot to the charm of the game. A solid game and can't wait to see what else they do to it. \nWould highly recommend for anyone that loves this style of game.",1

Plus, the devs have already laid out their plans for upcoming content, so we can expect even more cool stuff by the summer!",1
136742889,1183800,"So far a very nice game with a lot of tactical depth, there are somethings that I think could be improved:\n\n1. Actions like venting, overwatch etc. that all characters share should always be on the same button, so it becomes more intuitive to do the right action without checking the UI\n2. Its almost impossible to tell how far an enemy could be walking and whether or not he could be in range to attack your characters on the next turn, would be good if you could see their walking/attack range when hovering or selecting enemies\n3. Would be nice to have a UI scaling setting, so that texts are a bit easier to read on bigger screens\n4. Like others already mentioned, having some way of deciding the walking path (or automatic routing around dangers) would be helpful\n\nI will let you know if I find anything else :)",1
136742035,1183800,"Great game, finished it on easy so I can get most heroes unlocked, I wish future DLCs bring more variety to the maps, I enjoy the special missions but they are far to few compared to the same corridor mission grind. Some variety to the grenades also would be cool, like some grenades to get through the sniper special mission. Also a way to retreat if things go badly, without having to restart the run from scratch.",1
136741641,1183800,"Tough decision but since I think I'll be dropping the game for a while until it can get few bug and balance fixes and then hopefully change the review once/if the game gets better but I sadly couldn't recommend it now.\n\nThe good: There is a lot to like, as two-action tactical strategy with emphasis on cover it gets compared to xcom a lot and I can see why though it tones down the often illogical frustrations xcom is notorious for, if you stand next to enemy with a shotgun your character probably won't miss randomly. Sharpunk is more reasonable and while unexpected things still happen you probably won't have good tactically well executed run failed because of RNG lol. You might have it ruined for another reason entirely but I'll get to that...\n\nThe mechanics are sound (*when they work) and the graphics, music and sound are great as is the narrative. I've been quite hooked by the game until more and more issues would become visible and until I hit a brick wall.\n\nThe bad: The reliability I mentioned is great, but that it means it is even more jarring when things randomly bug out or happen unexpectedly. I've have characters hit by area effects even when they wouldn't be highlighted in the preview, getting party member hit despite standing outside what should be the cone. \nThe worst offender are the corners. Sometimes you can shoot through them, sometimes you can't, sometimes you'll have enemy shooting at you from 20 tiles away through solid wall because of some weirdness in line of sight as wall is either solid when out of los or full cover when in los but not flanked. The most obvious its with beneficial aoe effects, like the mech's support aura which sometimes works around the corners and sometimes don't leaving your characters without the effect when you least expect it. Sometimes some effects can be applied while others don't. The aura has multiple benefits, characters in it don't have their weapons heated up and get hit bonus. Multiple times I had the hit bonus applied but the weapons would still heat up. \n\nBut all this while annoying wouldn't have me drop the game or give it negative rating. The entirely wild difficulty swings that can end a run on literally unwinnable map do. I don't mind the losing is fun design. But when it  comes like hitting a brick wall giving you little to no chance to turn the tide is not. \n\nI started the game on easy as I'd often do despite playing a lot of turn based tactical games. I like to get into the mechanics first and I don't have need to prove myself how great gamer(tm) I am. I played the first few maps up to the bridge and I was pretty sure I'd go normal or even hard on next playthrough as everything had been going pretty well despite some bugs and annoyances. I've gathered tons of grenades, stimpaks and cores too. And then on the next map I ended completely overwhelmed by endless spawns of enemies. This had been after I removed the extra patrols modifier in mine mission. Yet on this map I got about to half of it until spawn just went crazy, new groups of enemies spawning every single round. I get you are supposed to get to the objective not kill rats but when 30+ rats spawn between you and the objective there's not much you can do. I ended pushed back, played the map for 4-5 hours and killed hundreds of vermin including 20+ ogres, used all of the supplies I had horded up and and in whole that time never made any progress what so ever. New enemies would spawn as quickly as I was able to kill them, the stalemate would have me push forward and then retreat back (or die...). I'd get this on hard but on easy? With the other bugs I'm not even sure if the spawn simply bugged out or if your only chance on this map is supposed to rush through while you can or you're screwed for good. There's one thing xcom usually has on most maps which Shardpunk severely lacks and that's option to retreat and fight another day when the mission goes terribly wrong. \n\nSo after those 4-5 hours of playing and getting nowhere I've decided to put it down, wait for some bug and hopefully balance fixes as well and then maybe give it another try because as frustrating experience it had been I do like a lot of this game and I want to see more of it \n\n",0

136753571,1811990,"This game is great and has a refreshing take on both rougelikes and deckbuilding games. The mechanics are done well and the strategy and gameplay are fun. I genuinelly enjoyed so much of this game. There are, however, two issues I have that might prevent you from getting the game. The first is that there is not much variation despite it being a roguelike. There are only two variations of bosses for each level, and the 3 decks you can start with and hold most of the cards you use cannot be edited in any way. This might not seem like much but when the game expects you to play through the runs at least 100 times to unlock everything, you notice. The second issue is that the game is random about what cards it gives you, but there aren't enough to pick from or maybe just enough in general because trying to build to apply a specific status or do a specific thing is almost impossible and many of the quests require you to do so in order to complete them. All together I loved this game, but if you want to get it I would expect a short experience.",1

136753311,1811990,"Fun and difficult game that adds a lot of new and interesting mechanics to the genre. However, after playing for a while, it's becoming frustrating with how little choice you are given to build a deck that's actually good. My few wins are based way more on luck than good choice. \n\nI'm also not a fan of the end game boss mechanic. After finally building a good enough deck to win, it just gets used against me, which dampens my sense of victory quite a bit.",1

136753616,307950,Been playing this since 2021 when it was a solo title and released publicly across the world. I love it and its not perfect of course but they keep continuing to do better. put this on Geforce now as a steam game and give me a way to buy epic outfits that are unlockable and maybe previous battle passes to buy for some extra grinding and I'll love this even more.,1
136753468,307950,It's better than i expected,1
136753374,307950,"I have played Caliber since August 2022 prior to the Steam launch.\n\nGreat game overall for being F2P, good PVE/PVP 3rd person gameplay if you're looking for something that is similar to Ghost Recon Phantoms (RIP) or the old SOCOM games. \nContinuous regular updates for bugfixes/balancing and good communication with the Caliber team on discord.\nWasn't expecting much from it when I first started as it just seemed like one of those lower budget random foreign games but I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of it (graphics are good, lots of different mechanics, somewhat authentic operator designs from multiple different countries that you can tell the devs researched with some effort, etc). \n\nAs it is F2P, has a lot of monetization stuff to make your progress a lot quicker, which is annoying but expected of course. It is \""pay for convenience\"" but not \""pay to win\"".\n\nPros:\n- Graphics and character designs are pretty good.\n- Gameplay variety (has PVE, PVPVE, PVP and limited special gamemodes)\n- PVE isn't super easy even on lowest difficulty (you will die if you aren't paying attention or taking cover)\n- Large variety of different operators with different abilities, you have to level up operators by playing them to improve their abilities and make them more viable. Different operators have different play-styles and strategy.\n- Good communication with Caliber team (I personally saw a design error on an operator skin with an upside down NVG mount, brought it up on Discord with a screenshot, and the design was fixed within an update or two).\n- Very fun when playing as team and actually communicating. Bring your friends. Sometimes sucks though if solo-queuing and your team has braindeads/leavers or doesn't communicate at all.\n\nCons:\n- A lot of monetization that reduces your grinding. It is expected as game is F2P, but some of the real money prices for certain things are super high, such as $10-20 USD for a new operator to play (there are currently 68 operators, some are more expensive than others). You can grind for ingame credits by winning and doing challenges but it will probably take a couple days to grind out enough to buy one operator. I believe when you start out and do all the tutorials and stuff you have enough for a few operators to start out with though. Try them out at the Firing Range before you decide on what to buy / play as for awhile if you aren't going to drop real cash on the game.\n- Often has toxic players in PVP who get mad and quit if you lose a round (annoying, as this game is 4v4 you will be at a significant disadvantage).\n- High ping if you aren't in Russia. I believe this is less of a problem now as they have added back in US and EU servers.\n- Some balancing issues with operators.\n- Battlepass system is weird. Very expensive, comes in multiple different parts that are paid for separately, takes awhile to level, and the operators obtained from the end of the battlepass are unobtainable once the battlepass ends for a long while (months), in which they finally open up to being purchased by real money or credits.\n\nOverall I've been having a lot of fun on it and like to hop on when I don't feel like playing a draining game like COD, but still want to play a \""shooter\"".",1

Even combat with the special action system being shared across all units, you feel bad from wanting to use any of your new abilities because it'll ruin the fun from your friends. Even turn order being decided by the party each turn, it leads to \""no you, no you\"" elements of waiting for someone else to take their turn or the other way around of fighting who goes first. Going into town and not really controlling who you talk to or go since someone else did makes it clear this can be a great single player game but I would not buy it personally just for co-op at this stage.

136754742,2328760,"Pinball FX is a great game that builds on previous iterations. Some of the \nbiggest improvements you will notice are in the physics department and with the graphics \nand lighting. I am a seasoned digital pinball player and can tell you this is by far the closest\nthis game has come to having realistic physics. For me, the physics are what really sold\nme on this title and I have played it since its first release on the Epic Games Store.\nWhen you play digital pinball games, realistic physics can go a long way because \nit challenges you to make good shots and rewards you when you do but also punishes\nyou when you don't. In FX3, for example, the physics felt like the ball had a predetermined path\n(especially on the Zen tables) which is why I played the Williams titles for the majority of my playtime.\nThat is not the case with Pinball FX and because of the physics overhaul, I am finding myself enjoying\ntitles from FX3 that I didn't have much interest in before. \nThe second biggest improvement is the lighting and animations that you will notice while you are playing.\nThe Williams tables received a glow update that improved lighting specifically around the flashers which was\nvery noticeable.\n\nIf you are coming from FX3, the physics will feel a lot different at first and it will take getting used to because\nit's a different engine but you will notice how much more \""realistic\"" they feel the more you play.\nLastly, the amount of tables Pinball FX offers is actually quite insane. There is something for everyone. For old\ntimers like myself, I enjoy playing the Williams recreations the most but because of the renewed physics,\nI am also enjoying original titles like Crypt of the Necrodancer a lot.\n\n",1

It's also a story about love and expectations while also murdering monsters and helping save the kingdoms across the land.  Avoiding spoilers I remember it having a decent story although some NPCs were... annoying but that's to be expected.

136756710,1811990,"Wildfrost is a near 10/10 rogueLIKE deckbuilder with fantastic visuals, a gloriously catchy battle theme (especially in the first area) and meaningful/impactful decisions that drastically affect how you perform in your run.\n\nAddressing many of the negative reviews (its okay to genuinely not like the game of course) which state how absurdly difficult the combat and balancing is:\nThe the combat plays a bit like Slay the Spire but the few battles and heavy inter/intra-battle decision making is much more akin to something like Monster Train; If you make one or two big mistakes you WILL be punished rather hard. But the opposite is also true. Big combo plays and making an almost degenerative deck can have you crushing through monsters with relative ease.\n\nYes the game can be brutal. Yes the leaders aren't super consistent with choice at the beginning of the run. Building a deck, deciding if you needs charms or crowns, deciding if your starter cards should be munched....these are all things to consider while looking at your cards special abilities and those of the enemy. So for all those struggling, let me give a few tips that may help you engage with the game a little better, rather than just write it off as \""bad hard game.\""\n\n1. If you can safely go for combo kills, do it. That little bit of money adds up, especially if you want to blow it all on the charm vending machine.\n\n2. To meta progress, hit escape at find the achievements menu. Try and clear these to unlock various cards, charms and events.\n\n3. You can and should be moving your cards around in battle as direct responses to the battle situation every single turn. With this in mind, if the battle is almost over, use this chance to recall some of your more damaged companions so they will not incur the \""injury\"" debuff for next round. Also, your leader always full heals after every battle. Use this knowledge wisely to tank hits. Essentially, you want to be winning each battle as closely as possible to leader death. \n\n4. Save your charms until right before a battle. You may find another card later on that synergizes with the charm better. Or you may pick a card to work with a powerful charm.\n\n5. READ. THE. DANG. CARDS. Tooltips are there for a reason. Right click on cards to see more stats so you may better plan.\n\n6. Go slow, have fun. No need to rush, take your time and plan out moves.",1

136755971,1527950,"First thing I want to say is that the game isn't awful, but it isn't great currently either. My reasons are that the story isn't really a story it doesn't feel like, they seem more like side quests to which you can choose to either help one side or the other. During these \""story missions\"" you can kind of just go around the map and find them at locations which to me isn't too great, the reason being you don't get much backstory into the factions I am only on second story line but so far i haven't found a faction or group i really care about. The other thing from what I can tell (not tried but seems like can do this) is you never get locked in to helping a faction so i could do all the other factions quests for one side but get to the end back-stab the group I have been helping and others will think I am a hero.\n\nSecond is that the world is vast but very limited. I have travailed around and generally speaking all I can do is craft, kill, hunt (same as killing though), steal (which seems kind of pointless), explore few dungeons or bandit camps and do quests given at towns which are generally same as stuff listed above. \n\nSome ideas for more to do could be that like maybe getting your own town or village or castle to which you can have mercs with their own party limit (garrison) which could maybe go out and do assignments or just store your loot and you need to improve the structure there and that could get attacked. \n\nMaybe like a sandbox mode where you could actually be hired by a lord or group in wars against the other territories basically like a TRPG mountain blade get own territory or help lords take more and maybe raiding. \n\nMore dungeons for sure from what I can tell is 1 dungeon area per location.\n\nMore character interaction like randomly generated backstories or interactions beyond the 3 choice interaction already have. I have fair few members and I know none of their names they die I don't really care just off to the town for another.\n\nThat's just some ideas bit stumped at what else could be added honestly but I just feel needs to be more variety or a more engaging story.\n\nCombat in the game is alright I have had a few lag moments at start of playing or reloading in but nothing major. Combat can be fairly tactical but it is mostly thinking who is going first seeing what roles they have and dealing with ones you hate the most. If you play adaptive mode though the one where everything scales as you do then you need to think about everything every fight is just brutal. Got a farmer with his pitchfork and rags, you got heavy armour big shield and sharp stabby sword well ... that pitchfork was forged in dragon fire baby and it going to just pierce right through. \n\nThe other mode though where they level per area is much easier so I would play that honestly I restarted my whole campaign because the other mode was just brutal, it got to the point where I was either losing a person every fight or near death. Clearing out a strong bandit camp just seemed like was impossible because they always have equal or more troops due to reinforcement and same or higher stats.\n\nWhen comes to food, money and happiness I never had a problem honestly my party currently is 2 ponies and 10 people and i haven't struggled once with any of it to give an idea i still have 10D worth of food and 1.5k Krowns. Generally all you want is money get money buy food buy salt cook food feed them pay them and they happy to murder whoever.\n\nThat's my overview I am going to play the game to completion I don't think the game is like the worst thing to ever be made but it does feel like it drags on and is limited to what you can do I think it can become something really good it just needs more stuff to do, more engagement and fleshed out lore and backstories of places and people and a better story really but that could be too late to work on now so perhaps the other areas.\n\nScore 5/10 currently good but needs more \n",0

136757491,2328760,"First off, let me start by saying that I adored zen releases in the past, (mainly fx3, the deals they offered on bundles, ease of use and incredibly smooth gameplay) and ended up buying 99/100 tables, though I know there are more from lost licenses I was very pleased with the amount I spent. I never found Indiana Jones to be worth 3x the other tables, so I didnt purchase it. Then we get the announcement that a new, remastered game was coming in hot from Zen studios named Pinball FX that would be exclusive to Epic games for exactly 1 year. Here is where things started to go sour, with no option to move any tables or receive any vouchers from Zen to make the transition seamless. While I understood this gesture, I didnt understand why that also came with an awful version of the game, on Epic. Nearly unplayable. I accepted this and simply moved back to fx3, which I did not mind as I already had quite the collection of games to keep me busy.  Moving forward 1 year, we get the Steam release and to my incredible surprise, the game plays quite flawlessly albeit missing a native resolution (3840x1080, which worked flawlessly in fx3. 2560x1080 is the resolution I use in the meantime, which gives pretty significant black bars on both sides of the screen, and a slight downgrade on the resolution that shows a bit of jaggedness, no matter, the game still plays great). The game also now comes with an integrated orientation swapping setting, which is awesome and actually works on my screen, nearly looks like a full size pinball machine. So after exhausting my 1 day of free pinball pass, which is also a nice gesture, I looked to see if there were any options to swap my fx3 tables to no avail. Again, new engine, physics, graphics, which are all great, so I really dont mind paying for the tables I dont own on fx3 already,  HOWEVER, while this new version of the game is an incredibly well done version of what we have come to love over the years in fx3, I feel like it is pretty scummy to expect any sort of payment for tables that people own on your \""abandoned\"" platform, fx3, in your new game, pinball FX. The people who would end up continuing to support your game into the future, are the same ones you are looking right in the eye and saying \""pay again\"". No thanks. Great game, great remaster, awesome tables, scummy, SCUMMY tactics. I wont be recommending this game to anyone until they find a way to shake the hand of those who have supported their previous iterations for so long.\n\nAlso, 100$+ for a year of Pinball pass? lol. At 5$ a month I think they would get a lot more looks.",0
136756599,2328760,"After a year on Epic, this game should've been ready for release. It's not though, and it's definitely not ready to succeed FX3...\n\nIt has potential, for sure, but we'll have to see if this game will live up to it.",0
136758661,1364020,"First and foremost i love the game, loved the demo that was released and happy the game is out in Early Access, so far the game runs great with a few bugs here and there. However, my biggest complaint is how the severs work, even though i select on NA servers, i continue to get nothing but 250+ ping players from the other side of the world in my lobbies. It causes a fairly noticeable difference in the match compared to when playing with people from your region. Other than that crappy and weird server thing, i have no other issues or concerns.",1

Even in the beginning of your playthrough, there is a per-level upgrade choices and Shop that you can pick and access so that you can strategize your gameplan or your chosen meta. It's the best on both ways.\n\nAll I can nitpick is the lack of some sort of Tutorial. Nonetheless, it's a very good game.

136758933,1651560,"A fun little game, however still somewhat similar gameplay every playthrough. The tutorial forces you one way, and that does take some challenge/freedom away. The tutorial is forced so you can't really dodge that.\nWaiting for money and the chaotic NPCs AI is somewhat frustrating.\n\nThe artstyle is really cute and has some Luca (Disney Pixar) vibes but also adds some great new features for a citybuilder game that give it some future potential!",1

Because if you follow the quest lines right away then you kind of run out of things quickly(food, wood, stone, ect). I suggest taking your time and really looking around the little square you start off with and planning. Big complaint coming is I understand that this game is still in early access but I wish their was more to do. I've played about 30 hours and I feel like I've done everything I can.\nThe great things about this game so far is the music, narrator, graphics, and overall charm of the game. \nIf you liked games like banished, foundation, and other colony sims you'll love this one too.\nIn all I can say that I'm very excited to see where and how far this game goes.",1
136757730,1651560,"I was going to wait to review this, but seeing as the dev's are so impatient to let them come in naturally and are begging for reviews. Here is mine, shallow banished inspired settlement game. Is a few differences but starting out is the same as any, house, farm, lumber. I was bored at 34 minute mark, due to having to wait for time gated arrivals to unlock next building. I didn't see research tree, so it leads me to believe all unlocks are going to be dependent on the same \""goals\"" each play through. For me that kills replay value, as each one will be exact same process. At this time I cannot recommend it, have also requested a refund.\n\nIt is cute and quirky, but that is not enough to set it apart from all the other banished inspired games out there.",0

136758922,2372320,"First of, this game has potential, or at least could have.\n\nYou start of in a level select, weird with no introduction, but alright. I hit new game and got brought instantly in the game, graphics are fine but have this weird effect on them.\nIt felt pretty good moving around, most objects could be picked up and there was text showing me exactly what to do, or at least trying to tell me. The text showing where the eviction notice was was fine for the first level or two, but after that i felt it was fairly annoying seeing all the time. There could have been an option for it, but as said earlier, the graphics had a weird effect on them, and text was hard to read.\n\nIt was alright going through at first, but there was little to no variation, go and pick up the poem (optional) and then throw the eviction notice off. It quickly became bland and boring, as the map was only changing a bit.\n\nThe audio was meh at best. \""with stunning visuals and lifelike sound effects that fully immerse the players in the experience.\"" The only audio that i vividly remember is the music that just cuts off if you're in a level for too long. No variation in the audio either. Not even a sound effect for picking up a poem or throwing the eviction notice off.\n\nThe graphics as told earlier had a weird effect, but were fine. Immersive enough, but not better than anything like Boneworks, Pavlov or H3VR. Looking down though, you see a very undetailed \""map\"" of the construction people? If you fall down, then it renders with better quality, but you're not falling down all the time.\n\nControls were fine, grabbing onto most things is more than a few games can say. I was confused though when grabbing the handle of a drawer grabbed the entire drawer. You grab onto the entire model instead of just bits of it, which was unfortunate and sad. Also wish they had more things, triggers didn't even do anything other than just twitch the index finger.\n\nThere was a bug apparent too, hands getting stuck in things was not fun. You just get stuck there and have to twitch yourself a lot to fix it. Also, in a level, you started just by falling to the bottom of a container. I'm usually fine to falling, but not when its unexpected, nothing from stopping me from playing, but pretty bad for others if they can't expect it.\n\nThose were my main gripes about the game, but why include achievements if you're only going to have one that's given from starting up the game?\n\nI think this type of movement could be better utilised in a climbing game, or something of the sort. I would be more fine with most of these things if it was free, because free things don't usually expect quality, but having to pay, even if it's a low price is setting the standard higher. I think a few patches could maybe fix up some of these complaints though, but the game in its current form, is more bad than good.",0

136761840,1811990,"I have beaten the game once and here are my thoughts.\n\nNow first off is Wildfrost a good game?\n\nVery. It is quite fun and really makes you think.\n\nIs the balance flawed?\n\nVery.\n\nSome builds simply do not work and in most instances even if you are going for a build that can work you are reliant on specific units (in my case spice flag and the weaken damage charm I likely could have won without any of the other buffs on Mika but without being able to increase her combo reliably and maintain spice I would have had no win condition viable with what was given to me.) Often you just do not get the pieces you need to make a build work. For example say you get a unit in the shadow tribe that doubles afterburn.\n\nCool I'll do an afterburn build.\n\nSometimes you won't get any afterburn applying cards.\n\n2 x 0 = 0\n\nThis happens a lot in this game, and there is little means to manage it.\n\nYou can win and skill is important there are no per say FREE wins here but sometimes if the game isn't giving you the pieces you need you just kinda lose.\n\nYou may think you can reroll or skip cards.\n\nNone of that no you get 3 good luck fucker.\n\nThere aren't even many chances to take cards in the first place, you get around 6 before the first boss and if you don't have a good basis for your build by the time ya reach the area after that boss you are unlikley to survive.\n\nThere are also times the game can feel overwhelming with like up to 10 counters on screen and units to move around. It can often feel like a bunch of spinning plates even with a decent playable build.\n\nIn other games you can make a couple mistakes and still one, but in Wildfrost one missed position or one forgotten enemy who attacked one turn sooner than you planned for is a run ender.\n\nThe game is more overwhelming and has less wiggle room than anything else.\n\nThis isn't without pros it really makes you think which is great but it can be frustrating.\n\nNot to hammer home the comparison but if I misplay once in Slay The Spire I can still recover, there is risk reward and one bad roll on that risk or one unblocked attack is not the end of a run granted it does punish you.\n\nHere that one misplay does end a run and this can be frustrating especially when you simply didn't get the combo pieces you needed.\n\nSome builds I feel are underpowered are sacrifice builds for the shadow tribe and shell/healing builds.\n\nFor sacrifice builds you need multiple specific card or a main hero that can summon (which btw heroes are rng so good luck with that) otherwise it doesn't work even when t does it ramps up far to slowly to be useful often needing 2 cards played to do one thing even with some decent synergies.\n\nHealing and shell aka armor don't work cause means to apply healing or armor are to slow and in a game where enemies can in some cases one hit you they are not very helpful.\n\nThere are cases they can work but the scaling on them is VERY slow and dependent on getting very particular cards, in addition most healing cards have low max hp so one would assume that you could mix the two to cover that but most shield applying cards deal damage or lower your max hp so that's some pretty hard anti synergy.\n\nHow am I gonna use a healer with 4 max hp when most enemies have 6+ attack?\n\nAnd they heal two?\n\nSee above point.\n\nThe real issue in my opinion is how punishing the game is compared to others and how dependent you can be on card rng in particular when you have so few chances to try to get other cards every draw really counts.",1
136761635,1811990,"It really is very good. The difficulty is definitely high but in a rewarding and fair way, like dark souls or such like Comfortably beatable. Absolutely stellar music, visual presentation and all round experience",1
136761551,1811990,"I was skeptical about this game, because it received mixed reviews (15.04.23). I really liked slay the spire and this game looked similar enough that I gave it a shot. I am glad that I did. Only played it for 9 hours so far, beat the game only once. So its not easy and sometimes you get surprised by how abilities interact, but you die and you learn. So this is not an easy game, but dang its fun. There are many different ways you can go about finding a win condition and so far few runs looked similar (You have to make work what you get and the choices didnt feel forced, but I dont know what I am doing yet). Kind of like when I started with slay the spire, until you figure out what works and what the great synergies are. The artstyle is cute and I like it. Overall, I would recommend the game, if you dont mind a challenging game.",1
136761550,1811990,"I don't normally review but the skew of positive/negative reviews seems insane considering how high quality this product is.\n\nDifficulty: This is most people's main gripe but if you love a challenge with rogue like deckbuilders, then Wildfrost is excellent. It is harder to begin with than Monster Train or Slay the Spire but this difficulty eases up as you unlock more features. Sadly the features take a while to unlock, but are very easy unlocks that encourage you to try out all styles of play in the game. Once you beat the game (and the first difficulty was easily beatable in 5 or so hours) you can add modifiers to increase the difficulty. Personally, I cannot stand rogue likes that are too easy and make you grind through countless ascension levels just to become a challenge. For me, Wildfrost hit the balance of challenge right, otherwise it simply would not be a good game if you won every time.\n\nGraphic and Design: Impeccable, succinct and streamlined.\n\nBalance: This could do with some shakeups as certain playstyles  do feel imbalanced and easier to get results with. However, the game is well balanced with a ton of variety in enemies.\n\nI highly recommend this to any deckbuilder veterans.\n\nBalance.",1
136761121,1811990,"Writing a review because of the numerous unjustified negative reviews around.\n\nWildfrost is a well executed roguelike deckbuilder with an engaging gameplay loop, clean and cute designs, interesting core mechanics, and a variety of valid strategies. As many others have already stated, the game is difficult but definitely not unbeatable or (imo) unbalanced. The game requires careful consideration and planning during battles which might mean taking a few minutes per turn every now and again. From my personal experience, most of my runs have ended owing to faulty decision on my end rather than unbeatable enemy encounters. It is not only vital to collect cards that synergize but also to have answers for various enemy types and situations in your deck. \n\nOverall, if you have played and enjoyed similar games, I can wholeheartedly recommend Wildfrost and I truly hope that the unwarranted percentage of negative reviews does not rob the game of the attetion it deserves.",1

136762192,307950,"After having played for 23 hours and getting a good grip with the game I can recomend it. The game is fun, the gunplay is good, not the best I've seen but still good and for a change it actually has PVE modes (imagine a game that does that in 2023, it's almost as if the developers wanted the game to have success). I played  the PVP and PVEVP to try once for the rewards but honestly I'm not a fan of anything with PVP, however it seemed just fine though take my opinion on the PVP content with a grain of salt.\n\nThe buisness model seems fairish. The prices are a bit high for cosmetics in my opinion but it seems fine otherwise. It's is playable free and I really don't believe that buying anything is required at all. You can gain XP faster if you have premium but because your money will not progress anywhere nearly as fast as your XP, grinding the money is the real deal and therefore you don't even need premium. Something could be said about being able to spend real money for the in game money trade which reminds me of the aweful rates of WoT and such (this game used to be tied to wargamming not sure if it still is) but overall it seems alright.\n\nThe negatives points from my perspective are in the customisation. Characters are gender locked and though other skins exist they are always the same gender. This is a big let down for me and since the gender makes no different in the gameplay, it would be better to allow everyone to play whatever gender they want, even if through a skin. If they lowered the prices but made many skins of different genders it could easily become a good revenue source.\n\nAnother thing that you can't customise is your loadout. You can swap your cosumables to some minor degree and chose whether or not to add the fixed upgrades you unlock for your guns. You don't get to chose what scopes you have and what silencers you have and different mag types and so on. I believe this will let down a lot of players and though it would change the gameplay a bit, especially with the mags I'm sure it wouldn't be hard to balance. Another let down is how all scopes are fixed zoom (at least I haven't seen them being able to zoom in and out but I could have missed it).\n\nAll in all, it's still a fun game and it's free so give it a try, it won't cost you anything.",1

136760312,2375650,"I got hold of a beta test key. With this beta test key, I wasn't able to figure out how to rotate the camera which I really wanted. A controller works well, and there is no tutorial. I did find a fellow deer, but this deer was floating backwards. I believe the goal of the maps was to move towards a yellow mineral which moved me to a different map with other blips on the map. Walking through trees is possible, and I saw no collision detection. The deer I was controlling had very strange colours, and the deer had a slight animation problems when it was running up or down hills. I would have preferred a more natural looking deer. The most off putting thing is when walking up or down a hill and the immobile camera showed the underside of the hill. The sky coloured bottom below my deer and short line of land separating my deer from falling forever wasn't relaxing to see. My deer didn't fall through the land though, so big plus.\n\nSince I have a beta test key, I'll assume the bugs I found are a result of that.

136762209,2328760,"TLDR: Bring some stonking good PC hardware for the raytracing & HDR benefits, otherwise you may as well stick to FX3 for the time being, until further optimisations are made.\n\nMy vote could go either way on Pinball FX at the present moment.  My own *personal* experience would lean toward a highly-qualified \""recommended\"", but only because I have a rather powerful gaming PC and an HDR display that can do this title justice.  I have an 11th gen i7 processor and a RTX 3070Ti GPU with a 144hz Gsync 1440p HDR display... which is upper mid-tier hardware atm.  I can run Pinball FX with Raytracing and HDR enabled in Portrait/TATE mode at @100-120 fps.... at 70% display scaling (1080p effectively).  This isn't as bad as it sounds, because it would seem that display scaling doesn't not affect rendered element in a linear fashion.  The playfield texture resolution, for example, seems to maintain 100% (or close) resolution even at 70% scaling, so it's really only the 3D ramps/rails and raytracing elements that seem to lose definition with the reduced scaling.\n\nThe point is - expect that you'll need to compromise on some settings if you have anything less than an RTX 4090 gpu.  To my mind, 60fps is simply not good enough for natural-feeling pinball.  You will probably have to turn down some settings to hit a smooth, flowing, responsive FPS.  I find that it needs at least a more-or-less consistent 90 FPS before it starts looking/feeling good.  120 FPS or higher is buttery smooth.  And of course, you need to have Vsync disabled, or you will feel the input lag.  Which also means that your display will require variable refresh rate  (VRR/GSync/FreeSync) or you will experience tearing.  Some of this is not Pinball FX's fault, to be fair.\n\nThis new Pinball FX has exactly 2 things going for it, as compared to the previous Pinball FX3: raytraced lighting and HDR support.  The updated physics are... fine... but I thought they were fine before.  If your PC hardware doesn't have some serious heft to it in order to push raytracing and HDR... well, then... you might as well stick to FX3 imo.\n\nBut, with raytracing and HDR enabled.... wow.  I mean, it really is quite visually stunning!  Being able to play my two favourite IRL tables of all time in Pinball FX (Twilight Zone and The Addams Family), in portrait mode, with raytracing and HDR enabled.  That's the stuff of my dreams - it's really, really excellent.  I would massively recommend THAT experience.  But you won't get THAT experience unless you come packing a behemoth of a dedicated PC gaming rig, and that's the main reason I can't give a thumbs-up right now.\n\nPinball FX doesn't currently support AMD FSR 2.0 (or higher - 3.0 is releasing soon) and it doesn't support DLSS.  So, enabling raytracing on support hardware will cut your FPS *BY HALF* -seriously!  It feels like a lot more people could enjoy these tables the way they're meant to be enjoyed if this software were to support current upscaling technologies.  Also, Pinball FX claims to finally support custom camera settings for each table.  That's only slightly true.  The settings are incredibly limited to just a few broad camera tilt adjustments at the moment.  That's not proper custom camera support.  Pinball FX claims to have cabinet settings for a separate backglass and DMD positioning.  But if you enable it, the application drops from fullscreen into borderless windowed mode, meaning you're stuck with Windows always-enabled Vsync (input lag!) and a 60 FPS cap.  Lame!\n\nThere's a lot of potential here for the developers to implement performance-saving image upscaling methods, more granular display settings, proper custom camera settings, and more.  If they do, then I will change my review and give my full heartfelt recommendation.  But, as it stands today, proceed with caution.  There is some absolutely awesome pinball available in here - but have you got the rig and the display to access it?",0

I have not seen if it will eventually be possible for you citizens to have kids, though I hope they will be able to as death is also going on. \n\nIf you like city builders and following a project from start you could already get this game, otherwise I'd recommended people to wait a couple months for some more content.",1

They definitely knew what they were doing.,1
136764803,1798010,"I bought the complete collection (pt.1 and pt.2)\n\nThere's two questions to ask/answer when looking at this purchase:\n\n1: Is this collection worth the price tag? \nAnswer: Yes;\n\nas someone who's played and owned all the old cartridges back in the day, let me say this release has been a bit of a dream come true. \n\nQoL changes, AI upscale filter for my old eyes, everything I know and love is in here + extra.\n\nIf you do the math the way I did at $60 USD, each game, including the alternate versions (3 White/Blue, 4RedSun/BlueMoon, 5Proto/Colonel, 6Gregar/Falzar) you absolutely SHOULD play both versions as they contain entirely separate characters in the story that you'll face off against. so to get the entire Battle Network 3 experience you'll need to play both Blue and White, etc. \n\nbased on this alone I already justified the purchase as a steal at $6 per game, with working Online Multiplayer functions. They imported that Japanese exclusive Battle Chips that were only given away during promotions and the only way to get them in America was to use a GameShark or ActionReplay\n\n_________________\n\n2: Is this a good game/franchise to get into\n\noh my god, yeah, this is really good shit. 10/10.\nan action RPG, with card battler elements, and fast-paced battles with a strategic 3x3 grid layout. \n\nThe combat is the coolest and hardest thing to describe and it's only after you mess around with the intricate systems and start virus busting and building out your chip library and finding cool Program Advances that you really get a feel for it and it becomes so rewarding and enjoyable. \n\nif any part of you is even considering playing this or is a little bit curious; definitely check it out. These games are so near and dear to me and they will always have a special place in my heart. \n\nThere is a sense of charm from the pixel style graphics, but it almost lends itself full circle back to an indie game scene that is has since inspired.\n\nPart 1 remaster contains Megaman Battlenetwork 1, Battle Network 2, Battle Network 3 (Blue version and White version)",1

136760978,1922010,"Loving the game. It is rare when a VR game is released for it to be smooth, intuitive, and fun. I am very happy with it and hope it has support for a long time. My only complaints is every single gun feels the same and everything fires with practically zero recoil that it's like firing a .22lr round. Time to kill is so incredibly fast people can VERY easily laser beam your face and survive a 2v1 is very rare unless you have the drop and even then......",1

Looking forward to another play-though.  Definitely one for Tron fans, also good if you enjoy the chilled 'interactive story' style.\n\nThe only thing I found awkward was the defrag minigame - but I think it mostly clicked by the fourth defrag event, at least I certainly found it easier to play after that despite the minigame becoming more complex as I progressed.",1

I can't wait to see how the branching will look like as I play further in the next episodes.\n\nOne of the things I loved  was the way it tackles themes like friendship, love, and the struggles of pursuing your dreams. It felt like a true coming-of-age story that was relatable and emotional, at least for me.\n\nI can fully relate to the plot so far, and I am so glad I wishlisted this a few months ago.",1

136765959,1913870,"Full video review here: https://youtu.be/3uIjfgtZv2k\n\nTray Racers is a really fun procedurally generated party racing game. There are currently 2 game modes (not sure if there will be more in the future): time trials and racing lobbies. Up to 16 people can race in a lobby, and because the tracks are randomized, it always feels like you have a chance at winning since it's not like anyone gets the advantage of practicing before you. The way the races work is you get 5 minutes of practice all together and then one final race. The winners are determined by both the practice trial times and the final race time.\n\nI played this game on stream as well and had chat members join in for races, and it was extremely fun and everyone had a great time. Tray Racers oozes charm and the surprise of \""what comes next\"" with each race keeps everyone's attention.\n\nIf you like racing games or want to try something new, definitely check this out.

No weapon is too strong or too weak.\n- Movement is also a solid plus. Can be a bit clunky at times, but gets better with practice.\n- Operators in game have stats and abilities that are unique to them, loadout options are pretty flexible.\n- No Astrophysics PhD required!\n\nThe Bad:\n- No region locked servers, so it's practically guaranteed that you'll encounter players above 300 ping.\n- Uses ACE anti-cheat, which can be a red flag for some people.\n- Operator abilities have 0 description on how they work, so you're basically forced to figure it out for yourself.\n- Some maps are small, other maps are way too large. Some maps are predominantly indoors, other maps demand fighting out in the open.\n- An in-game currency (obtained as a reward for leveling up) which, at the time of writing this review, has no use whatsoever.\n\nOnce again, I do recommend this game, just not for the time being.

136765134,2367980,"[i]The Witch, Wife, & the Wish[/i] is a very short single-read novel without any choices that will take less than 30 minutes to read from start to finish.\n\n[h1]Story[/h1]\nWestley is a married man whose wife is lost to him.  She is suffering from a malady which means she cannot remember him.  So he leaves his village to visit a witch in a nearby enchanted forest; a witch who \u201csells\u201d wish fulfilment in order to make a living.\n\nHe asks her to cure his wife so that they can live happily together again.  What transpires is a very bittersweet narrative which builds the relationship between customer (Westley) and supplier (Charlotte, the witch) before revealing the truth \u2013 which, in itself, is very easy to pre-empt just by absorbing the initial exchanges.\n\n[h1]Positives[/h1]\nDespite its extreme brevity, by keeping it very simple and focusing on only the two main players (although a 3rd person does appear briefly) and the one story thread, the writer successfully creates a false depth which makes the leads endearing and has the reader supporting them.\n\nFor a free game, both graphics and sound are fine.  Graphically simple, with a slight blur on the background which fits the atmosphere.\n\nThe English isn't [i]quite[/i] perfect, but it's close enough to not matter.\n\n[h1]Negatives[/h1]\nFor me, the game opened in a small window covering about one quarter of the screen.  I found that odd.\n\nThere's no \u201cback\u201d button, although there is a good log.\n\nThe text speed is preset, so sometimes you're waiting for it to finish before reading or moving on, as it is not instant.\n\nAt the end of the story, it simply says \u201cThe End\u201d, and you have to X in the top corner to close it.\n\nIt is literally so short that the story itself remains unresolved.  I'd add that this is as opposed to unfinished, it's clearly meant to be left \u201copen\u201d, but as the writer successfully makes one care about the characters, it's a pity that there isn't a properly satisfactory conclusion.\n\n[h1]Verdict[/h1]\nIt's nice, sweet, and for less than the time it takes to wait while dinner cooks, it fills time pleasantly when you have a little gap that isn't long enough to do anything else.  It's definitely worth a visit, it won't cost you anything except a few minutes that you probably wouldn't use more constructively anyway if you found the opportunity to look in the first place.\n\nQuite an easy recommendation, this one.\n\n[quote] Please follow our curator page, [url=https://store.steampowered.com/curator/4680120/]Otome Lovers[/url], if you'd like to see more reviews like this one!

136783136,1811990,"Love this game. It's cute and ruthless, which is a perfect combo in my opinion. The traits and combos in this game are so satisfying, it's crazy. \n\nIt's difficult, and difficulty is not a flaw necessarily. Just like any other roguelike, when you're new to the game it will be messy and you'll die a lot, but gradually you'll get the hang of it.",1
136783078,1811990,"The game is hard, for sure, but it's not as unfair as other folks have said.\n\nThe strategy is deeper than in many other games in the genre.\n\nI've won about 4 times our of maybe 7-10 runs. There are really very awesome combos to discover.\n\nThere are some cards that I think are unplayable in their randomness. Soulbound Skulls and Ice Dice are the worst offenders I've seen so far, but most cards are quite reasonable.\n\nOverall, it's great. I'm excited to see how the devs will respond to the difficulty and the problem cards, but if you enjoy very challenging, order-of-operations type puzzle games, this is solid game!",1
136782663,1811990,"TLDR: If you like deck building rogue-likes and aren't afraid for a tough challenge, you will enjoy this game despite the sometimes unfair nature of the RNG. Don't let the adorable art fool you...this game is for hardcore fans of the genre only.\n\nPros:\n- Interesting decisions to make.\n- Fun card combos.\n- Lots of unlockables.\n- Great art and music.\n\nCons:\n- Limited card options out of the gate.\n- Takes a while to gain enough knowledge to mitigate the RNG.\n- About 30% of your games will end early due to RNG putting you in an impossible situation right out of the gate.\n\nOverall: It's a fun game that definitely scratches that Slay The Spire itch I have. I am enjoying it, but it's also a bit frustrating sometimes because the enemies and RNG can result in you getting curb stomped without any chance to stop it. That being said, I'd definitely recommend it for those looking for a more intense deck building rogue-like experience.",1
136782504,1811990,Game is excellent. Pay no attention to the bad reviews.,1
136782027,1811990,"A lot of the reviews say this game is too luck dependent or too hard. I do not see it. If you have experience with high ascension slay the spire or monster train, this game will not be too difficult at all. I lost my first two runs learning the game, then went on a 3 win streak immediately after. \nDifficulty aside, this game is very fun. There are many different heroes from different factions to pick, and the cards have good synergy. If you have a good eye for synergy, then experimenting with builds is often rewarded.\nThis is a very good deck builder roguelike, and will scratch that itch if you are burned out from Slay the spire or monster train.",1
136782018,1811990,"The vibe is perfect! Aesthetics, soundtrack, and mechanics are all on point. That being said, this game is not for easy wins. It is challenging, and one wrong move could land you a game over.",1
136781843,1811990,I like this game but i'm bad. Skill Issue.,1
136781403,1811990,"I admit the whole controversy about the difficulty just made me buy the game because I was interested in what of it was true. So here I am and 3,5 hourse later I got my first win after 7 or so attempts. That being said I am a veteran who play most deck builders since Slay the spire and have beaten Library of Ruina without mods. I get how many people could have difficulty beating this game. Some encounters are really hard and some are unbeatable if you dont have a counter in your deck. Knowing that counter in your first playthrough is impossible. \n\nBut this isnt unfair. This is a roguelike with progression. Losing and learning are part of the game. Yes it is extremely difficult. Just like learning to swim is difficult. Your gonna dip your head underwater till you learn it. If you dont wnat that, stay out of the pool.\n\nThe game itself is fine, has extremely nice art and is quite different from other games of its kind. Turns are played in a way that you play cards, which either place units, companions and scrap items, on the field or have active effects. Each card you play is a turn that reduces the activation of every unit on the field. Those that hit 0 make their actions (attack, heal, whatever). \n\nWith that you try to kill the enemy boss before your boss dies. Your boss is a unit on the field and you can pick one out of 3 at the start each run. Those have randomized HP, Attack, activation time and special effects. Companions can be recalled to be healed, but if they die they\u00b4re gone for the battle and have half HP and Attack for one fight after that. \n\nYou also get charms which you can attach to cards. A lot of charms can be attached to units and active cards. So if a charm increases the number of activations that means your unit can attacks twice when it activates or an active card activates its effect twice and so on. You can attach up to three charms to a card which can lead to really silly and busted combos. And you NEED these. The later fights are unbeatable without at least one busted unit. And this is FUN. I love creating busted combos but in most games having these just means you breeze through the run. Here you need ot do this to have a chance. This means RNG is a large part in what you get. If you dont like that, then this isnt the game for you. If you like building the best of what you get with being force to use extremely different tactics each run, then this is the game for you. \n\nSpoiler for the end of a run:\nThere also seems to be a mechanic where the deck you win a run with gets possesed by the boss at the end? I dont know what that means yet, I assume you have to fight your own deck at some point. But since I dont have any more time today I cant tell you what that is about.",1
136781243,1811990,"I love the game, it's been great fun. My only complaint so far is the lack of counterplay to teeth damage. Unless you have a ton of hp on all your units, or you have built a deck that can direct kill your 10+ hp of problems, teeth damage really don't have the same level of counterplay that all the other keywords have. You can't stop your hero from attacking, so when a unit generates with a random teeth charm on the front line the same turn your hero is ready to attack with their 1 hp, there's just nothing you can do. Which feels extremely punishing for \""bad luck\"". \n\nUnlike most other abilities, neither ink nor frost will bail you out of that situation, and you cannot retreat your hero, so unless you have a self freeze or a kill spell to take out the spawned unit, there's just nothing you can do, which is really annoying.\n\nI still love this game, but I've lost several runs at this point to unfortunate teeth appearing out of nowhere. And I wish there was just more I could do about it.",1

When the door was closed at his viewpoint, the killer didn't come in and only growled outside. When the door was open at his viewpoint (for me door closed), the killer teleported inside the room and killed my friend at my viewpoint.

Realistic to see only a short distance, but only having a cylinder range in the middle of the screen, with total black on both sides creates a sense of being trapped in a bad way. I had to constantly turn my head up, down, left and right to look for stuff, which made me feel irritated and gradually dizzy in two hours.\n-The vision shakes too much.

136785379,1811990,"WIldfrost is a new take on a well-trod genre, that of the deckbuilding roguelike.\n\nWith an appealing artistic direction, you lead a group of companions through the snowy landscape while facing an array of challenging bosses. At its core, each run is about both creating a strong deck and making tight tactical decision during a variety of combats. Your deck must be one that straddles the line of both having a synergistic means of scaling against increasingly tough threats while also having the versatility to deal with many different threats, which proves an engaging challenge. This is akin to similar games such as Slay the Spire, but the margin for error here is tighter, which is likely the cause for many of the negative reviews. Secondly, each encounter requires maneuvering your units around enemies that are on discrete timers, reminiscent of Through the Breach. \n\nIn testing both dimensions, Wildfrost creates an experience that is greater than the sum of its parts. With some added quality of life features and some balancing (note, the issue here is more about the perception of balance than any actual balance), Wildfrost will become one of the top roguelike deckbuilders if it is not already.\n\nStrong recommend\n\nEdit: Upon looking at the other reviews, at present (April 16, 2023), the English language reviews are 85% positive while all reviews are at ~65% positive, meaning that non-English reviews are less than 50% positive. I'd suspect that there's some issue with how the mechanics are depicted in non-English languages (it seems many of the negative reviews are in Mandarin).",1
136785265,1811990,"Charming game. The main draw is probably the aesthetics, though the card battling itself is fairly mechanically unique, which is pretty necessary when the 'indie card rogue-lite' genre is currently so over-saturated. It's currently being review bombed for it's atypically harsh difficulty, which isn't at the level where it's worth being called 'unbalanced' or considered an objective flaw, but the game also isn't exactly marketed as the 'dark souls of card games' or anything, so many players seem to have been blindsided. \n\nIf you aren't afraid of having to put in effort to succeed, or of sometimes losing a run despite your best efforts, these negative reviews shouldn't dissuade you. The game is, in my experience, entirely free of the issues that would otherwise justify a negative review- no performance issues, all the systems function as intended, and the concept of the game is solid.\nI would like to see a little more player control over the deck they assemble though. Especially the starting deck. I know this is somewhat antithetical to the genre (the rng is part of being a rogue-like), but setting out with the intention of building a deck around the 'shroom' mechanic, and then completing the run having never been given the option to take even one card related to 'shrooms' can be frustrating in an entirely different way than difficulty. You can already choose your leader and pet at the start of the run, except not really because the available leaders are three randomly generated options, and sometimes they'll all be bad, or just not what you want for your run, and there is no re-roll or quick-restart. This sort of complaint is easily remedied though- just a re-roll button, or 'build your own leader' option, and perhaps a few more systems that unlock more player choice as they progress (like the pets).",1

136785019,1651560,Chill Game Easy To Get Into. Still In Early Access So Some Stuff Is Not Yet Available. Note: Food Runs Out Fast And Houses Freeze If Not Heated.\n\n\nDoors can accidentally be block if you put a building up against the blue indicators keeping workers from moving stuff into the building it is up against.

136784045,1651560,"[b]Who is the game for?[/b]\nCity Builder players who want a fun and relaxing casual experience. If you are looking to try this genre out for the first time, this is the perfect game for you as the entry barrier to learn the game isn't high. The game has a unique characteristic thanks to the art style, the narrator, and a few cute surprises you'll encounter along the way.\n\n[b]How is the game's performance?[/b] \nGameplay's smooth. It's not a game that requires 144 FPS, and isn't here to eat a lot of your computer's resources. No crashes ever since the game's release apart from the small texture issues. However, there's currently an issue with the game using 100% of your GPU. It's not an issue for everyone though.\n\n[b]What are the devs like?[/b]\nLike this game, the people behind it have the same characteristics. It's a pretty small team and they're vocal about the changes they want  to put in that are based out of data they gathered. \n\n[b]Would you recommend this game?[/b] \nYes, specifically for the people who think they want something chill, casual, and fun to play especially if they need something in between their hardcore games. I've enjoyed the city building aspect so much.\n\nNot yet for people who want tons of content.",1

136783807,1183800,"A fun game I picked up for roughly 12$. The mechanics are solid, the initial crew is more than capable of handling the roughest patches of gameplay. Normal mode for experienced Turn Based players will be an okay introduction, but the real meat is on hard mode and beyond. The resource management is really loose and allows for rapid experimentation between levels. The stress mechanics play hard and loose early on in the game, but mid-late it's a non-factor.\n\nRating: DESTROY THE VERMIN/10",1

136784731,1934520,"I randomly came across this game, and as a massive fan of roguelikes and, more recently, survivor-likes, I found this one to look interesting. It was on sale, but the negative reviews warned of a horrific sounding mechanic where if too many enemies were on the map, your run just ends. Sounds counter-intuitive to this type of game. There was an update just recently where this mechanic was changed from outright killing you to immensely debuffing you instead. I decided to take the plunge with a 20% discount and try my luck.\n\nI did not enjoy it. I couldn't get past the first boss, the first level, nothing. I'm not saying it's all the game's fault, but I found many frustrating, anti-gaming mechanics thrown in here that made little sense beyond packing the game in with frustration. You start off with a very slow firing, low damage bow that fires automatically. You'll get swarmed pretty quickly in this game. The balance of ramping up the amount of enemies versus your own power is very tipped towards the enemy. I found myself hitting the limits of this baffling horde mechanic in no time. Had I played the patch previous, I wouldn't have made it past the first minute in any run. Even with the change, this horde mechanic still helps stack the deck very much against you. I didn't see a reliable way of powering yourself up. The chests are random and may not give you what you need, the \""Sister Statues\"" will only buff you if you take a debuff first or will add to the enemy count/decrease your max HP/other penelty if you don't take the blessing, and the first \""boss\"" I encountered was a slime enemy that messes with your movement big time by causing the ground to be slippy and force you into obstacles and enemies against your will. It is abnormally easy to be surrounded and trapped against an obstacle, causing a quick and frustrating death. This all coalesces into a gaming experience that is not fun, at least in my eyes. \n\nPart of the charm of the survivor-like, at least for me, is the power ramp of your character. A bit of a peak of difficulty is expected, but only in line with your own power increase. Every mechanic in this game seems designed to build the difficulty wall and force you to scale it with almost no increase to your own power. It is supremely unfun. \n\nMy last run, which was my best attempt at it, is what decided I was going to refund this. I was slipping around because of the slime boss, not having any real way to even get to it because there were so many enemies on the screen blocking it. These are enemies that will push you around, drain your health quickly, and all of that is multiplied due to the horde mechanic which will almost always be maxed out. I definitely tried seeking out chests, forges, sister statues for blessings (even if they hampered me further). I activated a statue which would give me a random blessing, but the trade off is that I had the slime debuff, on me (which I already had permanently because the slime boss was still alive) until I found a corresponding statue which was marked. I just decided to run there because any help I can get against this ridiculous tide of enemies that I had no real chance against I would take. But, for whatever reason, the framerate started plummeting. I somehow ended up at literally single digit frames where it would skip to a future frame maybe once every few seconds. I was able to pause and navigate the menu okay, but any graphical changes I would make did not help whatsoever (potentially not helped by the simple graphical options I had). My guess was that the mixture of amount of enemies densely pooled together caused the game to deteriorate. For reference, my computer has Intel i9-9900K processor, NVIDIA RTX 2070 Super, and 32 GB of RAM. I should not be experiencing such a thing.\n\nSo, the above has caused me to initiate a refund and share my negative experience. It is a shame, because I really like these types of games.",0

136787876,1811990,"For you not interested in my rant that will follow. I am in love with wildfrost allready. I have watched streamers for many more hours playing it, besides my own experience with the game. It does not deserve the mixed reviews. Personally I put it up there after Monster Train and Vault of the Void. Two of the best card games in my opinion.\n\nThe first runs, on the starting difficulty are easy. And I have died 15+ times before beating the boss the first time. Wildfrost expects you to pay attention to the board, plan your moves. Your dmg output and your HP pool. The action economy instead of mana is implemented in a genious way, but in the end, it is a game you have to learn to play as if it was your first card game. And that is what I believe makes everyone think it is unballanced. Your skills from other card games come into this one, but you have to adapt them.\n\nI would highly suggest catching a stream of Celerity or Esty8nine on twitch if you are not sure if Wildfrost is for you. The communities there are awesome, and can help you decide.\n\nEvery run is so interesting, the cards interact in so many ways depending on the board and the modifiers on them (charms).  It is crazy how polished the game is mechanically. The run variety is amazing. The unlocks add to the complexity of the game gradually. There are 3 factions that play quite differently. And overall feels so fresh in a game genre where the majority of games are more of the same formula, or not so good attempts to innovate.\n\nAn amazing card game!",1

136786732,307950,"Good game buried beneath bad monetization and bad tutorials. Caliber really does what it's trying to do well; a third person semi-tactical hero shooter. The problems lie with the meh balancing and insane grind. Every operator upgrade can either feel like an incredible boost in power or a waste of credits. The cost of said upgrades becomes exponentially higher the more you level up an operator whereby it can take potentially a week of grinding for the final upgrades. Just to be clear, [b]these can be straight upgrades to HP and stats for an operator.[/b] This is an inherently unbalanced and frankly P2W system they've established for the core game. It doesn't improve the gameplay in the slightest and in fact makes it more difficult for newcomers to get invested. The tutorials don't explain the way vision works or how you should deal with PVP. Any and all tactics can be throw out the window by simply being a crack shot with an unbalanced operative. Wargaming was apparently involved in the development of this game and it shows. There are hints of what could have been a much harsher monetization system but that's just speculation. The damage has bee done and this game is likely going to maintain the overly grindy progression. It's worth a try but I would not get heavily invested unless you truly enjoy the game.",0

136790091,1527950,"Didn't think this would be my kind of game but here we are. Haven't really played too many indie games but this has been pleasantly surprising. If you are a fan of low fantasy novels, this is your opportunity to play along!",1
136789497,1527950,"Best RPG, Survivalist and Turn Base game. From Casual to Hardcore.\n\nIf you the type who likes to just jump in and learn as you go, it takes a few playthrough in the first region to get in to the grove of the game.\n\nOtherwise, because of its Co-op. It has a strong community, watch a few videos on classes and survival management. Even knowing what to expect, game still will challenge you all the way to end.",1
136789872,1364020,"First and foremost I really really wanted to like this game. It has a very cool premise and the map design is super neat. Being able to move in every direction is something that not a lot of shooters do and it really adds a bit of complexity to finding enemies. Being able to see enemies moving the distance and around cover based on their thrusters is something you will have to learn and control as you try to sneak around or reposition around the battlefield. Cosmetics were neat but seem unfinished as their is a currency in the game but nothing to spend it on. The best part of the game is the fact that you can grab any weapon and go into a range to test it out quickly. Unfortunately that is where the good ends.\n\nGuns and Classes are super unbalanced. The tank class offers no more survivability than other classes with the added negative of being the slowest class with the worst weapons. All the other classes play pretty much the same with the only real differences being the mobility items which either stop you in your tracks or give you a lot of speed, or the weapons which only makes a difference if you can't get a hold of the DMR or TK47 as those are far and wide the best guns in the game right now.\n\nTTK and connection are inconsistent as there are only 3 servers currently and the game mashes everyone from the US, Europe, and Asia into the same servers constantly. I was constantly killed by people that had not appeared on my screen or in only 2-3 rounds after I had dumped 8-9 shots into them only getting hit markers, and that's if my bullets didn't simply pass through them. \n\nNew players will be highly disadvantaged to the game as more people unlock better weapons and attachments as the lower tier attachments almost hinder your gameplay more than help. Sights are clunky and take up too much of your vision or are just plain unhelpful against the inky darkness of space. This serves to only push new players out of the game when they get repeatedly crushed by opponents that have access to better options that new players will have trouble unlocking because everything requires kills to unlock. \n\nMenus are good to look at but unhelpful and clunky. Selecting equipment shows no description of what it does beyond a few basic stats. Frequently guns would lose attachments between games and have to be re-edited after the match. Some attachments offer 0 upside while actively harming the guns stats. The path to unlocking attachments is long and take a lot of grinding against opponents that will be more deadly as the game goes on with little recourse to level the playing field other than picking the assault class and grinding out the TK47.\n\nRespawn systems are also a weakpoint of the game as I was constantly trapped in a 2-3 spawn point cycle of getting gunned down by people sitting just outside of our spawn shooting us before our character would ready their weapon. \n\nOverall the game could use a lot of balancing changes to the weapons/classes to make them actually feel unique and balanced. Cluttering up some spaces so that snipers are not dominant and able to shoot from one spawn to the other. Progression system rebalancing so that new players are not locked out of weapon attachments for quite as long. Lastly better match making so that players can choose which server they would like to play on instead of getting pushed to a server that is far away and having massive ping in the process.",0

136789345,1649740,"I personally quite liked it. While I hate using direct comparisons to other games, it felt like a 2D Zelda game with Bloodborne-esque bosses and areas.\n\nIt was definitely a bit short (it took me just short of 11 hours to beat it with a good amount of extra exploration), but I found it was well worth the $20 I paid. The combat felt rewarding, especially dashing in and out to land hits with my greatsword and/or shotgun, although some enemies were a bit of a pain to fight. Also, while I never found any boss to be overly difficult, they all gave a decent enough challenge to be enjoyable, and they often had really great designs. I did notice a few odd performance/design issues, such as the music abruptly cutting at screen transitions or when resting at crow statues, and the hitboxes do occasionally seem a bit weird, but nothing seemed too bad. Enemies also respawn in most rooms upon re-entering, and I got hit once or twice upon entering a room, which isn't the best, but it wasn't terrible or frequent either. The story was nice, and I especially like how parts of it were told in pieces by picking up feathers containing lore. Also, the spritework was *really* good.\n\nWould recommend!",1
136789687,1778060,"Actually trash. Visuals like a game from 2004, controls barely work, you can't shoot across gaps, you can't partial move, action, then move again, basic actions like Dodge or Dash are nonexistent, enemies have no AI and don't move until you're within attack range, the End Turn button is buggy, picking up items is buggy, you can try to move and use up all your movespeed without actually moving.\n\nOh, and the menu looks crap and the only graphics options are 480p and 720p. The 1080p button changes it back to 480p again.",0
136790320,1183800,"The gameplay is very reminiscent of XCOM and somewhat reminiscent of Darkest Dungeon, and honestly way better than the gameplay of both of those games. If you liked XCOM's gameplay, you're going to love Shardpunk: Verminfall.\n\nThe biggest issue I have with this game is with its difficulty settings. Normal is a little too easy, and Hard can be literally impossible; hard difficulty multiplies the number of enemy spawns, so on stages that further multiply enemy power, like Deadly Enemies, you get stages that are literally impossible to beat.\n\nGame is cheap, and easily worth its cost.",1

136789211,1922010,"[b]Summary:[/b]\nIt's simple, it's fun, but it's lacking in content.\n\nPlayers mileage will vary depending on how much they like the competitive nature, local community and general game play. Personally I've gotten my money's worth during this and the beta play time. Encounters can become stale and samey after a while, with preset destructible locations leads players/traps to becoming kind of predictable.\n\n[b]Visuals:[/b]\n- Visuals are nothing to write home about, they're fine and suit the intended purpose. A lot of complaints about it, but nothing objectively terrible - just a whole lot of unrealistic entitled opinions. Personally, I appreciate being able to maintain a steady FPS on 120hz.  \n- Clipping plane may need to be lowered for higher FOV headsets it seems, it's exploitable on the index and according to another comment may be worse on the Pimax.\n\n[b]Gameplay:[/b]\n\n- Movement is unrestrained and responsive to inputs unlike Pavlov with it's speed ramp/playspace movement kill system. It's simple, but it's fun.  \n- Aiming feels smooth and doesn't lead to feeling outclassed by v-stock users, though have heard one player comment that they feel like controllers are being smoothed out too much tracking wise - but I haven't found issue with it. \n- The lean mechanic is under-appreciated by players, but is really neat piece of game design. Sometimes feels like a minor de-sync from player hit box though, in one extreme case a player put down their headset and visual mesh was completely disconnected from hit box location by about 2 meters. \n- Weapon mechanics (active reload) are non-existent for balancing purposes, but it kind of feels like a cop out - the frustration from waiting for an arbitrary cool down period to fire your gun after reload kind of sucks.\n- Bullet penetration. It exists between players, but there's times that feel like you're registering limb damage instead of head/head. Unsure, but it was an concern that players block head shots due to hands in front of head.\n- Balance wise there's many guns that feel lacking a purpose. The Auril & Urakan in particular stands out, Canutt is incredibly unreliable and Viper/RCB may need adjustment.\n- Factory is the best map out of the three competitive maps visually and mechanically it just feels balanced design wise - perfect amount of long distance -> medium/short range encounters with each bomb site feels distinct.\nCompared to hideout which feels almost too busy and bland with it's small rooms and winding corridors. Skyscraper, mixed thoughts - one pair of bombsites needs more accessibility for attackers imo.\n\n[b]Sound:[/b]\n- Sound is incredibly important in this game, a lot of players don't either have it up loud enough or lack game sense to distinguish friend from foe.\n- Seems to be inconsistent across players, unsure why or if true but it's leading to a lot of frustration. My sound on 100% index, I can hear footsteps just fine. \n- Directionality needs work though. It's impossible to distinguish between up and down floors without relying on map knowledge for material sounds. \n- Spectators are able to heard sound anywhere on the map, which gives the dead players something to do - help track alive enemies and report positions to friendlies which is usually accurate to about a 4m radius. \nWhich is fun for me and gives a purpose to dead team mates but feels like it needs to or will be removed. \nIt brings on a lot of comments with people feeling like players have wall hacks, but that's more an issue with unskilled/uncoordinated pub matches. Ideally would like it to stay, but can see why it would go.  \n\n[b]Wishlist:[/b]\n- [u]Kill trade system/reduced bullet deletion[/u] - There's too many encounters where both players may land shots but one will register faster then the other leading to their shot being deleted. The problem with this is that blood effects play before the player loses control and dies, leading to frustrated players that know they have made the shot, know they saw blood\nand accounting for weapon damage knows that should be an instant kill. This would also help cross regional play. From my experience it's frustrating enough with a 50 ping difference against equally skilled players. \n- [u]Player model clipping[/u] - Low priority but there's a lot of thin surfaces that players are resting against their model will clip through leading to them getting shot in the back through a wall. \n- [u]Ping markers[/u] on broken walls need to be fixed, allows spectators to identify what's been breached despite no visibility.\n- [u]Bots[/u] get stuck at doors was a big issue before in the beta, seems like it may still be an issue. In general, they're super frustrating at times, aim locking you through walls and corners. 1 tap head shots at great distances, to not being able to kill a player within a meter. \n- [u]Toggle Grip - Vive Wands[/u] are vastly under-appreciated. For someone with re-occuring wrist problems, they're most comfortable controller for me to use. Having a hold to grip system makes them a no go. For comparison, I can't use a quest 2 or reverb G2 controller without major pain. Along with the reliability and input response make them preferable to knuckles. This issue is stopping users from purchasing the game and was requested back in beta to no avail.\n- [u]Player moderation[/u] - It's understandable that devs wish to prevent player abuse, but not allowing players to moderate themselves in their local communities is frankly silly. \nThis has lead to a lot of instances of player trolling with ping spam/flash bangs/FF/noise/camping, with no way to kick afk or people abusing glitches/bugs, or simply being abusive.\nHaving to record footage on the players end for ban reports on the discord, or using the in game system surely leads to an increase on dev time on mundane matters, no? - when players could simply kick and move on with their day.\n- [b][u]Ping needs a separate audio control in options[/u][/b] - It's incredibly triggering and distracting. You can mute players to stop this, but if they're unconnected to the VC then they're free to spam. But alternatively you may want to chat with them just not hear the ping sound. They're frankly abrasive, a cool down wouldn't hurt either but mostly just want a mute.\n- [u]Grenades[/u] feel like they need a better radial damage system. There are times players are within 1 meter but receive no damage, one instance of a player standing directly on top of the nade survived. Mostly just if it roles underneath some small gap, table or trolley it won't hurt an adjacent player. In particular ballistic room on Factory.\n- [u]Local match recording/playback system[/u] - It feels like it may be scope creep at this point in time when more content is needed but there's too many times people call bullshit hacks. Post-game this would at least allow a player to re-wind and examine their mistakes.",1

136798987,1364020,"After nearly 9 hours playing this game I feel its time to review.\n\nLets start with the pros.\n\nGraphics and visuals 10/10.\nGun play takes me back to Cod BO2 clean, precise and balanced.\nMovement is on point it takes a little getting use to but when you figure it out its truly unique.\nProgression is an enjoyable experience and does not feel like a chore (Looking at you MW2.0)\nMaps are good fun and a nice balance with some really big maps and some smaller maps as well\nloads of choice with how you want to play the maps!\n\nNow for some cons\n\nIt does not default you to a region so expect some high ping player you can select a region but some do not or clearly don't want to so you often find a high ping player with a name not written in letters.\nThe waiting time for the match to start needs halving as its far to long it does jump down when are all players are ready but most of the time there is someone who has not readied up.\nHalf time is back on Domination ( I love its back but some will hate it i feel its a con more than a pro also that timer needs removing ;D)\nYou aim at people to tag them its a good feature the con is the XP it gives you that shows up right where the kill confirmed XP shows often leading to you thinking you've killed someone who was only marked.\n\nSo after sharing what IMO is the pros and cons of the game I would say with the current state of the game and the price its selling at that its 100% worth getting this game its EA its already being patched and its already better than a lot of other shooters out there in a few months time we could have a really solid shooter set to last for a while so take the leap and pick your copy up today.\n\n",1

136800887,1797630,"Great game. I really liked the characters, story, music, and the concept behind the game play. I also absolutely love the ending and twists along the way. \n\nHowever, sometimes the players don't make very sound decisions, and using certain abilities exploitatively will guarantee you a win. The game eliminates the person with the least amount of chips after a certain amount of hands, and the last one standing wins. You can use this to your advantage and just fold every hand while you have the chip lead to secure a win as well. Your opponents won't do this so you'll still have a chance sometimes when facing a deficit. With changes to some of the abilities and the opponents actions, I think this game could be a lot better. \n\nOverall, this game is a blast and is always keeping you in suspense.

I've seen a few negative reviews that dislike the feel of the combat, but to each their own, I suppose.

Game starts off pretty hard but once you get a few key level ups, you can start chewing through enemies with your cooldown based abilities. I am incredibly impressed with how unique each character is and how varied their individual playstyles are. This game is a rogue-lite technically but each (winning) run will take well over 10 hours, probably closer to the 15-20 hours for your first run.\n\nI cannot stress enough just how FUN this game is and how much I've fallen in love with it. Its genuinely an improvement on the games that it gathered so much inspiration from. This game tries to do so much and succeeds on almost every point, you can clearly see the passion behind this title and the audience really does benefit from it. This is the easiest recommend that I have had in years.\n\nDespite all my praise, there are three [i] small [/i] gripes I have with this game:\n[*]  the XCOM Fog of War pod aggro system. If you move one tile too far you can pretty much be ambushed by enemies you're very much not ready for. Can slow the pace of the game significantly on certain maps.\n\n[*]  no undo button for non-chance related actions. You overwatched someone and then realized 5 seconds later a much better use of their turn? Too bad, overwatch can't be de-activated even though it hasn't really taken effect yet.\n\n[*]  there's an upgrade that gives you the ability to give an action to any character once per map ...except you can't use that ability on characters that have no remaining actions. For an ability that's once per map, it feels really bad to pre-emptively pop that once per map action on someone just in case they miss their 85% shot. Should have the option to provide that action to anyone, regardless of their current remaining actions.",1

For FX3 players you can either just buy the new tables or any tables you already own on FX3 will be available at 50% off which is pretty reasonable. My number one wish would be some lighting options especially on the Williams tables. It would be nice to tweak the brightness of the lights or maybe have a night time / day time lighting option.,1

136824654,1649740,"Hunt the night is a top down souls-like that, especially in regards to the lore and environmental storytelling, delivers an amazing experience. The music and art of this game are exceptional, and the exploration is very satisfying, especially when any part of the environment could be a key to understanding a key piece of lore.\n\nThe game does an AMAZING job of encouraging the player to engage in the lore, with many puzzles being tied directly to it. I dont think they are so complicated that you need a full understanding of the lore or anything close to it, but by asking the player to even lightly interact with the lore to progress, it gives a base level understanding of the world and story being told even to a player who may otherwise not be reading things or thinking about it.\n\nNow, I know not everyone is into the storytelling side of things, and as far as game play goes, I have been thoroughly enjoying learning the combat. For me, the combat is secondary to what really makes this game so amazing, but it is still fun. The boss fights have been challenging but not frustrating so far, which I always appreciate.\n\nHunt the Night is absolutely worth your time, and if they add full steamdeck support with cloud saving, it will take it to the next level.",1

136827167,1651560,"Impressive for such an incredibly small team. Cute, relaxing, though sometimes perplexing game at this stage. Lacks content, but it's clearly in the works. Balancing resources, people, money, and employment can be a challenge at times. \n\nI thought peasants would leave if they were homeless for too long since that's what the writing implied, but they just straight up starved to death without a home and dropped dead at the 'plaza.' So I unintentionally euthanized a third of my people when trying to replace peasants with common folk from lack of space. Then my common folk also began starving too- I'm wondering if \""They're more demanding\"" means they consume more food? I got confused there.\n\nAnyhow, after mass murdering dozens of people I made a new save and it's going great...\n\nCoal makers feel highly inefficient with little employment, slow production, low desirability, and high upkeep after so many of them- only for the game to not even react if my people don't have coal to heat their homes in the winter. So I opted to just let them freeze since it's easy to ignore with no consequence. Coal makers are definitely my least favorite building in the game.\n\nI hope the next neighboring ruler is a guy who looks... a touch more handsome than Giovanni... his character design is creative, funny, and unique- but I'm -not- that desperate. Oh dear.\n\nI'd love a preview of what royalty/nobility points could unlock for me in the future. For now, I didn't care too much- though the pop up quests not having an option to decline without penalty (especially early on in the game) stressed me out. It felt like time was rolling the dice as to whether I was punished or punished less harshly, especially when struggling with money and food already. Hell, an option to turn those off for a more relaxing experience would be great too. It reminded me of sim city's random destruction events.\n\nMy least important peeve was the cake-like fog around the border edge of the map. Kinda kills my immersion when I view a map and the visual horizon from my camera doesn't match up, but I also have no idea how this could be fixed and I can see why the developers picked such a solution for now at least.\n\nThis game is cute and fun though, I'd probably play it again alongside Dorfromantik whenever I want something less intense than the usual.",1

136828719,1798010,"Alright look these are good games. Great games even. But for $60 (and I feel spoiled saying this cause I know it's only $10 a game or $6 if you include all versions) I expected more. This is literally the bare minimum and if this version didn't give you online battle and trading abilities the emulated versions would not only serve the same purpose for free but would actually be better. You would be able to have a black border that doesn't ruin oled screens, remap buttons, toggle run, fast forward, and save state for all the shitty stupid not fun parts. This version doesn't fix any of the old translation errors which is infuriating. \""Go left to get to the netdealer. Turn right at the square and follow the big path.\"" Apparently that means the netdealer is on the left and the square is to the right. Nonsensical. The left bumper \""hint\"" is still useless garbage. Hmm I'm doing a quest so I can take the exam. What was the quest again or where am I supposed to go? Lemme ask for a hint. The hint just says lets finish the quest so we can take the exam. Like you seriously couldn't go back through and give real hints? So then you either look up a guide or jack out and run halfway across town to see what the quest was or where you are supposed to go. Can't set spoken and written languages separately. The graphics suck. I know I get it it's an old game but they said they remade it. You really couldn't upscale at all? You literally have to make the window smaller than your screen for it to look decent. Which leaves you with the border which can't be made plain black and is super ugly. Even if you play at full size there is still side borders because they didn't bother to make the game wide screen. There is some filter that is supposed to make it look better but it looks worse. And on top of all this stupid other bullshit they put denuvo on it which makes no sense because the only reason not to emulate the game is for the online capabilities. If somebody pirated this version it wouldn't have online and at that point it would just be worse than an emulator. There is literally no reason to pirate this version and they slap denuvo on it anyway and now people with steam decks and laptops can't play on the go without an internet connection. Idk man like I'm keeping the game and going to play because I don't have anything else I wanna play right now and I do want to trade and battle online and AGAIN THESE ARE REALLY FUN GAMES but this is just such a lazy minimal port that I can't recommend it for $60. Which again I feel bad saying knowing it's $6 a game but shit man they could have at least tried instead of coasting on the fact that online play would make this the only option. Very disappointing overall. If you aren't going to play online just get an emulator. There apparently is some previously japanese exclusive content in this version that wouldn't be in the emulated one but idk if that alone is worth $60 if you aren't going to play online. It's just extremely frustrating to put off replaying some of these for this release only to find out you get a better experience for free on emulators.",0

I'm sure we'll also see more courting options and combinations in the weeks to come.\nOverall this is an overwhelmingly adorable, satisfyingly cozy game and I cannot get enough of it.",1

There's not much more content outside what you see in the demo.\n\nIt is very cute though, with stylistic decisions I can get behind. I also like how they're making some of the structures less static than just placing squares and rectangles. They do need to extend this to more buildings than just housing and stockpiles though.\n\nThe biggest problem right now is that the \""fable\"" part of the name is fairly cosmetic at this point. We are dealing with pigs with wings, there's a princess, and a talking tree somewhere on the map. Otherwise, it's just a regular city builder like you've played before. I've built the well for my houses in so many games. I've built the tavern to make my people happy countless times before. I've built the wheat farms for my windmills for my bakeries every year since playing Settlers II back on windows 98. Let me build and set up actual fable stuff. What about needing to build mushroom huts for gnome citizens, and then I can employ them to spin straw into gold? Or trying to host a coven of wicked witches but trying to put together a sufficiently spooky swamp in time?\n\nUltimately, this game has potential, but in the same way that a lump of rainbow playdoh has potential.

I would build more fields and bakeries but for some reason it wouldn't help. It also made me sad that am in year nine of the game and I still can't build a fishermans hut, I feel like that would be an earlier build, but that's just my opinion on that.

Will I rebuy the rerendered boards I already own? Probably not. Fish Tales is only a little more detailed in this version. Nonetheless other new boards I will be purchasing when this is fixed.

The guns feel very satisfying, the reloads and grabbing are very slightly confusing, but just take some getting used to, and overall, the level of interactivity is moderately low, but just enough that it keeps the balance of the game in tact. \n\nEco/weapons feel very similar to Valorant or CSGO, with the tiers for purchasing weapons, weapon classifications, and damage feeling more similar to Valorant. If you understand some of the buys there, things are very uncomplicated. There's good weapon variety, and I actually think that the reload system (you simply drop the mag and put a new one in, then wait for the weapon to be ready) evens out the skill gap present in reloading VR guns. I'm mixed on this because I am very fast at reloading guns, but it also allows more people to engage with the game elements in a deeper way if they aren't muddled down in the moment to moment reloads. \n\nThe actual gameplay loop is extremely similar to when Siege first came out, with a slight mix of CS style throwables for good measure. Breaking down windows, clearing hallways, creating entries, it's all here aside from fully destroy-able walls. There are set breaching spots, but as I'm sure the designers of siege learned, that specific breach spots are probably for the best in terms of balance. Soft walls are a nightmare to balance around, and this game reaches a happy medium. \n\nThe gadgets are all moderately futuristic, and with a very polished, cohesive tutorial, it all feels quite intuitive. \""Ease of use\"" is a very nice way to put how most of the gadgets feel, aside from maybe grenades being that they have a higher skill ceiling inherently. \n\nThe gunplay feels great, the guns all sound very chunky and powerful, even the default pistol sounds adequately loud. Big pluses all around. \n\nMovement is surprisingly smooth, with the ever looming threat of VR sickness, it's hard to find a game that sets this level of smooth movement, and does it in a way that (to me) feels extremely good. If you feel comfortable playing Pavlov, you're gonna be just fine here more than likely. \n\nThat being said, Pavlov is a much more community focused game, whereas this game feels nearly competitive ready. The ability to see people only when teammates see them after death, the limitations on crouching, the ease of use, and the balance of weapons and gadgets, all of these are typically afterthoughts from developers after creating \""just another VR shooter\"" but this game is one of the most polished, thorough experiences I've had so far in VR. This is, if you're into shooters, probably a must buy. Sure, there are lots of Quest players with dying headsets, and the audience might be a bit young, but that certainly doesn't take away from how great this game plays and feels. \n\nFor the first time in a while, I got out of VR after getting a server disconnection, and as I write this I'm like, \""dang, I want to play more\"" which hasn't happened in a very long time in VR.",1

Physics break and even cause some tables to become unplayable, such as Funhouse which won't let the ball go anywhere but down center, no matter how much you thrash you flippers. The Visuals look the same except they now have blur and slowdown from a system that had neither of those issues in the prior release which was on higher settings too as opposed to medium on this current one.

Right now, running a short match with a small player count, going back to main menu, another quick game, main menu, quick game, main menu, it just isn't great for long-term replayability. I played 2 hours and felt like I went through 20 matches which wore me out.\n\n* Accessibility options that may help with character rotation in space. This is one of those inevitable games where you'll feel the vertigo/motion sickness. Something that would allow forcing a vertical map so your character is unable to rotate with feet always at what would be considered the ground. I understand this could take away from immersion or the whole reason you're playing a game in space, but it's also not unreasonable if it can decrease player count because of uncontrollable dizziness. I also don't see the 'well if you can't flip around you're at advantage' - on the contrary, I would think players that can would have the advantage.\n\n* You've spent years developing the most realistic FPS in space - why bog it down with cartoony/comedy skins and attachments and break the immersion? I'm sure the answer is that 'it sells', but this deserved to be mentioned. Imagine if the cosmetics and skins were military-esque or futuristic, as they should be?

Shardpunk: Verminfall is what you get when you grab a mixing bowl, add in dashes of XCOM, Darkest Dungeon and a few Skaven for good measure - mix it all together and this is what you get. I'll make this simple for you; you are going to fail runs, your soldiers will die and in most cases a lot of this will seem like BS or bad RNG. If this doesn't appeal to you, fair enough! This may not be for you!\n\nIn the 6 hours I've played so far, I want more. The visuals are lovely, the music is on point and the different classes and abilities are pretty cool. While I haven't come across every enemy type yet there are a wide variety of vermin to deal with, such as you rats with shivs, snipers and a few others I won't mention as to not spoil the fun! You can try and deal with the vermin as they approach - but be warned that you will be overrun in a matter of rounds if they get out of hand.\n\nDuring the turn based phase you can potentially find supplies that will help you once you reach a shelter. Once there you can create items, upgrade weapons and heal your soldiers to fight another day. You also get a little robot companion which is nice! DO NOT LET THEM DIE FOR THE LOVE OF GOD!\n\nIf you enjoy turn based games and getting smashed into the ground constantly, give this game a go!

136839129,1651560,I bought this because I really enjoyed Dungeon of Nehauleuk published by Dear Villagers.\n\nSurprisingly good city builder sim for early access with a lot of the humour shown in DoN. The real enjoyment for me will come when the RPG elements are built out into a proper story line. I get super bored with city building for city building sake so looking forward to the development releases.,1
136837934,1183800,"7/10\n\n- A fun gameplay loop that becomes repetitive after 4-5 scenarios. \n- Almost every scenario is moving left to right on the map, killing rats that appear predictably from corridors bordering the map. There is not much replay value, and maps are very linear.\n- Not nearly as many scenario types (rescue missions, etc.) as XCOM.\n- You'll either like the pixelart or dislike it. For me, it's a bit too pixely - I had trouble at times telling certain characters apart.\n- Music and sounds are fantastic. Probably the best part of the game for me.\n- The game is moderately challenging. It's not 'easy' as some might say, but once you learn the basic mechanics it's not hard to figure out the best placements for characters. \n- Each character has a mostly different role, though some are definitely more useful than others.\n- The story is not very good; neither is the theme, at least not for me. It's mostly just there to provide an excuse to do some turn based tactics gameplay.\n- The price is exactly where it should be for this game.\n\nI sound negativem, but the game is still quyite fun for what it is. Don't expect the variety or polish of XCOM. Mechanics are shallow, but the gameplay loop of turn based tactics is satisfying enough, and the game is short enough, to make it worth it for the price.

136841009,1651560,"For less than 20$? Absolutely recommend if you enjoy city build or are looking for a quirky and accessible entry in the genre. Even for early access i already feel like I've gotten my money's worth of enjoyment and time. Art is charming, and the world is whimsical. The detail in the houses/decorations make towns feel more real and alive. It's fun to just sit back and watch the world go.\n\nThere are some kinks to work out in regards to food supply imo, but nothing game breaking at the moment. It seems as if almost 1/2 of my land is devoted to vegetables, creating a constant need of an army of low level citizens to run them (farms are one of the, if not the, only building limited to low level citizens). But this seems like something that will likely be tweaked, or remedied by higher level food sources/buildings we don't have access to yet. \n\nI love the little event scenarios you can uncover. I've had a few that give some cosmetic decorations, and one that gave a permanent buff (and was a talking tree. love that). Hoping to see more of the later, so the events can feel more impactful and permanent in the world.\n\nTLDR; It's cute, quirky, and strangely relaxing for a city sim. Huge fan.",1

136841488,2252070,"I went into this game with meh expectations and was shocked at just how great it was. Fairly short game but the jumpscares were mind blowing. It sometimes had an Observer feel, sure it was no where near the Cyberpunk that that game was, but at least I felt it took a little from that. I think maybe the pricetag is scaring off a few from giving it a shot, but after I finished I recommended all my horror friends to give this a look see. There was one jump scare that caused me to knock off everything from my little table, everything flew off the table, my mouse flew and I flew LOL. Also I felt like the game was fairly easy to run, the controls were fairly easy. Puzzles were few and far between, but what was there was easy to solve. Graphics were amazing so no complaints there, it did get a little dark at times, but that can be adjusted somewhat in the menu. Yall give this game a shot you won't be disappointed.\n\nP.S This was my first review so sorry if it wasn't polished enough. I just had to say something about this game.",1
136840475,1567000,"I think this is mostly good and very impressive for being a solo dev project.\nThe art style is amazing, and I love the environments for most of the levels, with the city, the dali world, and the 2nd to last level being the highlights and my favorite levels in general. \n\nShooting is very basic and turning enemies into gore is always fun, but the gunplay and enemy variety is probably the weakest part of the game, especially since by the halfway point you've seen everything and the game never throws new mechanics at you.\n\nMusic is also good. The last thing I'll say is with an aesthetic this great I wish there was a little more going on with narrative, and things that tied the levels and characters together, because it's close to feeling cohesive and interesting but nothing really backs it up. I do like that what little story there is, is told entirely visually.\n\nI think if the dev decides to do another project I'd love to see a slower paced exploration, puzzle or even horror game that really gives you time to milk the art design and environments",1
136839776,1567000,"Love this game. I plan to do a full video review at some point, but I'll summarize my feelings here for now. 20 dollars and a 3-hour first playthrough well-spent.\n\nThere is no real story to this game. By the dev's own admission. I...kinda hate that John Carmack \""story in video games is like story in porn\"" quote, but I do like how little is elaborated on here. It doesn't just leave things open to interpretation, but it also leaves the game unshackled from any kind of \""canon\"" it has to build on. With that said, the little setpieces and environmental storytelling does create this sense of a connected experience I quite enjoy.\n\nSpeaking of setpieces and environments, this game oozes style. Every level is distinct in aesthetic, and often uses assets entirely unique form other levels. It's creepy and cartoony and deliciously visceral. I believe it's heavily implied to be a sort of dream that the player is experiencing. To that end, I kind of wish there was more abstract level design. Maybe titles like Anemoiopolis and MyHouse.wad spoiled me too much, but despite the surreal environments, the worlds often feel surprisingly grounded and cohesive. If there were ever any sort of sequel to this title, I hope the dev leans into things like what they did with the mirrors in Mystique House and go all-out with that non-euclidian space warping. I love that stuff any day of the week, and I cannot get enough.\n\nOh yeah and the OST slaps like a motherfucker. I've been calling it \""Burtoncore,\"" since that seems to evoke the sense of what you can expect from it. synthey, playful, but at the same time sinister and foreboding.\n\nThe gameplay is pretty simple. You got a jump and a double jump, and a bunch of guns that will feel pretty familiar to your average FPS enjoyer. Notable exceptions to this are the Microwave Gun - a replacement for your standard automatic which has the notable benefit of blowing up enemies if you can train your beam on them long enough. Think the Amid Evil Voltride, but much easier to pull off consistently. Also, the Worm Gun. I love the Worm Gun. One of the most unique and interesting guns in the game - and most fps games. Shoot a leech at your foes, set it and forget it (sorta like a Blood Flare Gun), but once it does its business, the leech becomes saturated with blood - and depending how much it got to feed, you can, uh...eat it. And heal up to 10hp! Try using it on the Pigbots!\n\nEven though most of the other weapons don't do anything terribly unique, they still feel great. You'll pick up an AR later on which is functionally superior to your base Shotgun in every way, but I still used the Shotgun. Because shooting it felt great and so does the flip-cock. I'm a sucker for flips and cock. We've all seen Grenade Launchers, but Illwill's firing speed and arc feels so satisfying. Once you play around with it a bit, it can start feeling almost second-nature to land direct hits with it. It isn't quite Blood TNT levels of intuition, but it's very close.\n\nThat said, there is some bloat to the weapon roster. Some redundancy in your guns. Regundancy, if you will. I think the game could remove the Rocket Launcher, Assault Rifle, and Soul Extractor, and not lose much besides additional ammo pools. The Soul Extractor is kind of interesting - killing Painheads with it won't cause them to explode when they die, and as far as I can tell, it prevents the target from shooting at you - but it's really just a high-damage automatic, and its little nuances rarely play a factor in how you use it.\n\nThe weapon balance migh have some misses in my option, but the enemy balance is EXCELLENT. Every enemy has a unique role, and the ways they play off of eachother, around the arenas, and against you makes for some great-feeling combat.\n\nOne other thing I'd like to mention: I really love the game's secret collectible. By collecting one of the three violins in each level, the player can increase their damage within that level by 10% - up to 30% with all 3. What a cool little reward for exploration! If you got good secret-hunting skills, you're rewarded with shorter kill times on automatics and in some cases, better kill thresholds on your shotguns and explosives! I really like that. :)\n\nOverall, I'd give this game a 4/5. Really good, solid title. I really like a lot of the systems here. But it could stand to be refined a little. If I ever see DLC or a followup to this in the future, I'll be snapping it up in an instant. Until then, I'm gonna 100% the shit outta this game.",1

136843308,1649740,"If I had to describe [i]Hunt the Night[/i] in it's current state, I would say it feels unfinished, almost like it should have been released in early access for some extra polish.\n\nDon't get me wrong, there's a lot going for the game: the pixel art, the music, the atmosphere, the world-building, the puzzles.\n\nBut there's just so many bad and confusing design choices that, despite 100%ing the game, leave me not wanting to recommend it until they work on it a bit more.\n\nThe biggest issue I have is with the combat: enemies have busted hitboxes, hit just a little too hard, and the combat is too clunky to allow you to handle encounters effectively. There's no animation-cancelling and no permanent way beyond gear to increase your attack or defense, just your HP, and beyond the max healing charges of 5, lifesteal is your only way of getting health back despite not working on everything. You can also poison enemies, but the proc chance and damage are so low it's almost not worth it.\n\nThe encounter design in particular is absolutely awful, with the game often swarming you with dozens of enemies, projectiles, or both that respawn between load screens despite the clunky combat not allowing you to handle multiple things going on at once very well. [spoiler]There's also a few bosses that ask the question of, \""what if it was the same encounter but now there's two of them? Or what if they can spawn trash mobs infinitely?\""[/spoiler]\n\nThere are also quite a few enemies that, while they do telegraph their attacks, have such a short reaction window that you're almost guaranteed to take damage from them unless you pick them off using a ranged attack. [spoiler]The invisible guys in particular are extremely annoying to deal with in packs for this reason[/spoiler].\n\nAnd considering combat, the most tedious aspect of the game, is also the core focus of the game, I found myself opting to run past all of the enemies after a certain point because it was not worth the time it took to fight them.\n\nThere's also a few small things I had issue with, such as:\n\n\u2022 The dash allowing you to fall off ledges or into bodies of liquid, only for the game to spawn you across the map or in another room entirely instead of the last surface you were standing on\n\u2022 Cutscenes replaying after failing to defeat certain bosses, instead of skipping straight to the encounter\n\u2022 One-way trips not having a confirmation before yeeting you into the abyss, resulting in needless backtracking\n\u2022 Area transitions that are poorly signposted save for some different lighting on the floor\n\u2022 No maps, although most areas aren't too difficult to navigate\n\u2022 Hunts not being marked as complete at the tavern\n\u2022 No audiovisual feedback when your dark energy is full or cooldown is over\n\u2022 No bestiary or game stats menu\n\u2022 Not enough weapon, gear, and enemy variety\n\u2022 Bizzare and jarring load-stutters when saving or transitioning to a new area\n\nAlso, there's a pretty major softlock after completing a puzzle (that resets itself if you get it wrong for some reason) in the final dungeon, [spoiler]Bloodisfell Cathedral,[/spoiler] and some other bugs such as levers getting stuck, players not being able to attack, getting stuck in geometry, and  item pickup notifications not appearing or using the wrong template. [spoiler]The Apothecary keys didn't have notifications and the white snake scale used the default NPC dialogue instead of the item notification[/spoiler].\n\nBut with all that being said I definitely think the game is worth keeping an eye on, so give it a few months or wait for a sale if it looks interesting.\n\nDisclaimer: The free key is because I was a Kickstarter backer.",0

There are some interesting elements that i havent seen in this genre before such as a player controlled hero which has equipable items. It also seems as though they will be adding armies later. There is political relations with neighbors with which you build either positive or negative relationships with. I hope that multiplayer is added at some point.

The only weird thing about this game is that it's too cheap. It's a weird thing to say since I'm paying very little for a ton of fun but It might scare away people that might think a game that is this cheap has no business being any good.

136844347,1797630,"Let's be clear, this not an awful game. It just fell short of what it could be. While the demo promised a mother-like rpg with poker instead of combat, the game feels more linear than I would have imagined. I'm a few hours in so far and am disappointed but overall enjoy the game. It's gotten a lot of Visual Novel comparison mostly because it's kind of like danganropa, but also because of its linearity and heavy diialogue.\n\nThe Dialogue is decent though overall and if you accept it for what it is you'll have a good time, but there are problems. For one, the poker is too easy, it may get harder later but it definitely leans into accessibility for everyone rather than lending itself to people who love poker. That being said, it totally is too niche for people who don't like poker. If you want to fight bat's in caves, this game will not scratch the itch.\n\nThe non poker games are fun, but the character says it himself, something like \""I came here to play poker, not lose money\"". Poker naturally lends itself to grinding through difficult and tight situations to get better and play against better opponents, this game decided instead to use poker in lieu of combat. They could be playing chess, the poker part is mostly irrelevant when it comes to the storyline\n\nIt all feels so over the top, like the cool magician poker rpg spiraled into something else which is fun but ultimately not the poker rpg I was hoping for. Its hard to recommend this to either people who want a poker game or people who want an rpg, but if you don't mind that it doesn't do either as well as it could, then this might work for you. I think there is potential for greatness and I wish the dev success in their future games.",0

136851903,1798010,"Out of all the \u201cbaby\u2019s first RPG\u201d titles I\u2019ve played as a child, this is the only series that\u2019s kept me coming back. You play as a schoolboy named Lan, who sends Mega Man into the internet or local networks (dungeons) through various electronic devices where most of the meaningful gameplay happens. You go through simple isometric mazes and solve basic puzzles, pick up cash and items, and get hounded by random encounters. There\u2019s a lot of fetch quests, repetition and archaic RPG design that may turn off a lot of people. None of that matters because Battle Network has peak Action RPG combat.\n\nCombat is a combination of card game and action game where you dodge enemy attacks by moving on a 3x3 grid, while the enemies do the same on another 3x3 grid. You can pick at enemies with your infinite-use Mega Buster but most of your damage will come from using cards (battlechips) with various uses, from simple projectiles to functions like icing the entire stage. You start off being able to draw so many chips and every few seconds you\u2019re able to pause the game to draw some more. Pausing constantly in an action game is usually a bad thing, but here it\u2019s good as it lets you formulate a strategy in the chaos. Enemies have predicable attack patterns, you may think \u201cThis guy is gonna jump around twice more and then stop to shoot me, I\u2019ll use this air chip to push him into same row as his friend, and then take them both out at once with this bomb chip!\u201d, things may go awry and then you\u2019ll have to improvise a new plan. As with any card game, your starting hand is randomly selected from the cards you put in your deck, this keeps encounters fresh since you\u2019ll be readjusting on how to best deal with the enemy with whatever you\u2019re dealt. Good deckbuilding is making sure you will never end up with a hand that\u2019s unusable. Skillful play is directly rewarded, your combat speed/efficacy is graded and gives you better rewards at the end of combat the better you do, giving you either more money or chips. You don\u2019t really level up traditionally, but cash is usually handy and chips are you main source of power. Even trash chips are welcome as you can use them to roll on a chip trader, which can give you basically any chip from more garbage to absurdly broken things you would otherwise need to S rank endgame level bosses for. In short, combat is fast, easy-to-understand and has a surprising amount of depth and customization for how simple it looks. Despite the problems these games have with content and balance, I would say the skeleton of this gameplay is basically perfect, and the best successor to Battle Network has cloned these fundamentals 1-to-1. Here\u2019s a rundown of the games themselves.\n\nBattle Network 1: The start of it all. The combat isn\u2019t as good as its sequels but it still has the core of what makes BN combat fun. Unfortunately the game is very rough in typical first-game fashion. It\u2019s short and the mechanics aren\u2019t well developed. The encounter rate is insane. The overworld is a barely-navigable mess with a single tileset and it has one of the worst dungeons ever made. I wouldn\u2019t say you should skip the game without trying it, but if you start getting frustrated with fumbling around in the dark there\u2019s not much shame in going ahead to a much better game.\n\nBattle Network 2: The typical Mega Man sequel where the devs nail it. The game is longer and much more polished. There\u2019s more than one visual theme in the overworld, so it\u2019s possible to navigate now. The combat/deckbuilding mechanics are much better and there\u2019s a new style system where the game buffs you based on your playstyle. For example if you draw a lot of chips you\u2019ll get the Custom style which lets you start a fight with more potential chips to draw, if you use the buster a lot you\u2019ll get the Guts style which buffs the buster. Unfortunately it can be grindy, if you somehow end up with a style you don\u2019t like you\u2019ll have to fight 200+ battles to get another one. You can level up styles by fighting battles, but all it does is strengthen your charge shot. Styles are still a positive addition, giving a lot of customization and depth. BN2 also starts the series\u2019 tendency towards surprisingly extensive post-game content. There\u2019s a lot of collecting/grinding involved if you want to do all of it, but entire areas, sidequests and unique bosses for expert players are only found after the credits roll. This is welcome, especially when a lot of RPGs are still content with giving you one superboss, if anything at all. One problem that will stick with the series is there\u2019s a decent amount of padding added, BN2 adds a lot of mundane fetch quests going back and forth across previously explored internet areas. One such section is atrociously bad, but for the others I\u2019m not gonna complain too much when the game asks me to engage in more combat. All-in-all this is a great game and a big improvement over its predecessor.\n\nBattle Network 3: BN3 takes BN2 and expands it even more. There\u2019s a greater variety of chips, enemies and bosses. There\u2019s a new \u201cNaviCust\u201d system where you place blocks (programs) down a grid to give Mega Man various benefits like a stronger buster or the ability to survive a fatal hit with 1 HP. It\u2019s basically inventory Tetris but with your stats and I wish more games had something like it. They weren\u2019t too sure how to implement it here though, as several parts of the internet/main quest require equipping a program to progress, forcing you to constantly swap out programs or gimp yourself by leaving on something that\u2019s otherwise useless. Styles are back and leveling them up gives you programs for the NaviCust, so you\u2019re encouraged to branch out instead of just sticking with one you like. BN3 is the longest in the series, but there\u2019s also even more padding than 2, which can be grating. On the other hand, BN3 also has an insane amount of postgame content, some say it\u2019s the second half of the game and they\u2019re probably right. If the game were made today content of this size would be paid DLC but it\u2019s just included in the game already, accessible only to the most dedicated players. Times have certainly changed. Unfortunately what has been consistent is Capcom\u2019s love of scummy business practices, this is the first game in the series to have two versions ala Pokemon. Thankfully its not too bad and they\u2019re both in Vol 1. There\u2019s a few chips and one style exclusive to each version, Blue is a bit more favorable due to having an extra boss but otherwise you can pick your favorite color between the two. Despite its problems, BN3 is excellent and one of the best games in the GBA\u2019s library.\n\nI didn\u2019t mention the story, it doesn\u2019t matter at all. It\u2019s episodic children's anime stuff about as meaningful as a classic Mega Man plot, but with more yelling about friendship and hearts. It\u2019s kinda fun thinking about how insane this world and its events are. The first dungeon in the series is a program forcing an oven to spit fire. It\u2019s weirdly prophetic as well, considering how many of the scenarios are about bad guys hacking devices that shouldn\u2019t have been made with any internet access to begin with. But if you want Deus Ex you should look elsewhere.\n\nFor what the collection adds, you get Mega Man talking to you on the game select menu, far from necessary but it\u2019s nice. There\u2019s typical extras like art galleries, trophies and a music player. The music is surprisingly good for GBA games, it\u2019s like the system\u2019s audio capabilities were made to make bubbly techno sound good and nothing else. You can import Japanese event exclusive chips which have been basically inaccessible by official means up until now. There\u2019s also online PVP and chip trading to help you collect them all, definitely beats a link cable.\n\nSo for Volume 1 you get a rough prototype of a game and two great games. There\u2019s a lot of stuff here, especially if you do post game content. I\u2019d say it\u2019s worth it even at its base price if you value excellent combat above all else.",1

136856614,1183800,"This game hooked me right from the start.\n\nI love the graphic style and all the detailed touches in each level.  I'm a big fan of games like XCOM and Darkest Dungeon and this game has successfully blended elements of the two.\n\nIn between combat missions is a DD-like \""camping\"" scenario where you get to select various buffs and actions that can heal or prepare characters for the upcoming combat.  It is a short but effective way to gear up and get to the next combat mission. Choices matter during this preparation step (especially before you unlock the power up that gives more actions).\n\nCombat is solid and similar to cover mechanics from other turn based games (like XCOM).  Each character feels unique and managing their strengths (and weaknesses) in battle is key for success. I'm only 8 hours into the game so far on my first playthrough but it has been a joy seeing characters take shape as they level up.  Gideon is my fave so far (I love me some sniper overwatch)\n\nI am the type of gamer who will delay starting a new game for fear of a large learning curve up front, but this game got me up to speed quickly with a solid tutorial mission (and compendium). \n\nDue to my short playing time so far I can't comment on the amount of content available.  That said, my enjoyment of the game so far is definitely worth the price listed.  In my opinion this game is a must have for tactical turn based combat fans.",1
136856162,1183800,"A fun game with some interesting mechanics and a nice take on the genre. Good music, good character design, maps have well designed layouts with some missions having 'special events' or curve balls that add an unique feel to the mission, occasionally requiring you to rethink your strategy.\n\nThe enemies are cool with good variety in types. Fun story.\n\nSome criticism is that the game is rather easy, I do play a lot of turn-based strategy games but even still, I think if you're new to the genre, you'll quickly find this game easy as well, so maybe start the game on hard (which feels like it should be normal to me). Some abilities are pretty OP, the katana combo for example or the heavy's 6 free weapon blasts, the game quickly snowballs into a rat slaughterfest. \n\nOverall a good game, a solid 7/10 for me that could easily be pushed to an 8 or 9 if it were slightly more challenging. Easily worth the price.",1

If they were more entertaining and fast paced, the experience would be better\n- Dogs/Cats can clip through walls, fences, gates, doors etc. I released my dogs into my yard and had to chase them all across the world to get them back. And I had a cat who just couldn't be contained.\n- Having to manually input booking info isn't a good gameplay choice as it adds nothing but a bit of annoyance. I'd remove it, and have booking info input automatically after you accept the pet through a phone call.\n- There should be an option to adopt your own pet that can free-roam the hotel whilst you're there, it'd be fun to name one and look after it yourself.\n- The tutorials are too long and should be integrated as tooltips into the actual gameplay, not as separate missions.",1

134589259,1818610,"Look im Sorry, but i had to not recommend this game... \n\nI love the scenery, i love the idea of the robot creatures, and being able to explore through ruins... but what is it all for? there is no story (and never will be). there is no reasoning for any of it. \nyes you can build - with a very limited toolset but its still possible. you can craft some things. sure. u can scan robots so you can make it yourself and arm them with a couple of guns. they dont do anything but still. There are different biomes to allow you to upgrade your robots to stronger versions with some materials. There is alot of possibility.\n\nBUT\n\nthe dev says its content complete.. that there is 50hrs of content. got to 30hrs and already in the last biome. there is no point to scanning the robots because they dont do anything worth while other than to ride. U cant control their shooting when u do put guns on them, they dont harvest anything and there are alot of still frustrating bugs around the robots. \nThis game is PLAYABLE.. but not enjoyable IMO. All you do is build, scan dinos for recipes and patterns and for armour you cant even use yet (not implemented yet. considering that its \""there\"" i assume it will be?)\nThe dev states that there will be no more major updates to the game, but yet there is nothing to the armour.. \n\nThere is no story line - dont expect one\nThere is no end game - Claims there is bosses but still havent found them after opening up the whole map\nThere is nothing new being added apparently. \nWhen suggestions are made in the community they are shot down because its not his view of the game. If you just wanted to make a game for yourself then dont publish it. or at least dont charge a stupid amount for such a lacking game. Listed to your community! There is a way to create a game and make a good portion of ur community happy (u will never satisfy everyone - but ur not even satisfying ANYONE that makes suggestions.). Sad part is alot of the suggestions are the same thing and yet it still gets brushed off.. things as simple as map markers (what is implemented is hardly \""map markers\"". u dont even know where ur team mates are), Ark had more than this did at its release... THIS game has more potential with a dev that has the ability but no care for the game it seems...\n\nAT LEAST ALLOW FOR WORKSHOP CONTENT BY OTHER PEOPLE!!! then all their bitching of what they want they can make in the workshop for your game and u never have to listen to it again.. its such a shame...\n\nIt has SO much potential.. but without a dev that cares.. it wont make squat on what it possibly could.. \n\nI see this as a dead game and just a money grab for the dev to \""fund\"" the 2 other games he is working on.\nExpretmely disappointed.\n",0

That being said, the games are still solid and presenting them in a complete package with all the extra download & patch cards does save a bit of time and setup headaches for dedicated fans. No issues performance-wise on multiple platforms, cloud saving is very nice. The home screen with animated megaman is pretty cool and his cliche voice lines are fun. The art and music galleries are very welcome inclusion since this series has some of the best of both on the GBA imo. \n\nThe biggest gripe I have is with the piss poor presentation of the actual game window and borders when playing the game. The screen resolution of the gba makes for a very clunky transition to modern displays, and it looks like exactly 0 effort was spent trying to make it look even close to decent. The border images don't line up with the game window at all on any setting - and to that point, why isn't there an option to just disable the border image and blow the game up to near fullscreen? There's a pretty solid pixel filter, so why not use it? Why aren't there CRT filter effects or simulated ghosting to make the game more visually appealing and nostalgically accurate?\n\nWould've loved to see a bit more effort put into possibly my favorite series on the gba, but oh well. 6/10 buy it on sale if you're inclined but your best bet is to just find alternative ways to play the game.",1

Still feels like I'm early into it, but I'm hoping to see some more weaponry and tactics that use the strafe vs random targeting since that's a key feature that makes it feel unique.\n\nThe format gives you more tangible goals too (reach wave 15) vs. open ended survive as long as possible which I appreciate. Animations are solid, you can tell a lot of work was done to not only get a lot of enemies on screen but also give you plenty of nice destruction effects going on.\n\nController support at launch is a plus and the price point is plenty fair.",1

136891704,1929250,"First impressions, pretty good. Straightforward progression that doesn't feel like a grind, surviving the onslaught can be addicting, and overall feeling of the game feels very rewarding. A definite recommend from me.\n\nSome criticisms I would give to the game:\n-The music is fine but the sound effects are a bit too \""sharp\"" and it kinda hurts the ears after a while.\n-There was no way to refer to the controls after the initial level. It would be nice to have a controls list in the pause menu.\n-Trying to line up the mech using the Spacebar was also a bit frustrating as you're weaving around enemies and running straight eventually leads to running into a big crowd.\n-The lack of control over the mech itself. I feel like this game is designed more for mobile in mind, so maybe that's the point, but I was really hoping to pilot the mech and have some control over the actions I performed other than WASD. Maybe have an option to automate/manually control certain actions, as well as be able to make the mech spin using the mouse (or using the arrow keys?) independently from movement. This also made it particularly frustrating when trying to fight the bosses, as I couldn't put my focus on any specific type of enemy.\n\nSo far, everything else is good and looking forward to playing more.

I will not recommend people to buy at this moment.\n\nSecond, the general cards are very weak in design, either over point or the growth over time is not really worth it. Just need to get a weapon and armor option is better than any general cards.\nTake example: Guan Yu, 3 point to use...+1 permenant attack to HIS card only when he killed a enemy. But there are many cards that increase OVERALL attack which cost lesser points. By the 10 rounds, it is useless as there are many cards option. In fact, Guan Yu card is a handicap to your deck LMAO in the start. You don't need to overkill the enemy. Same apply to Zhan Fei, useless card. These 2 cards needs to be redesign.",0

136995506,1862690,Good Game,1
136994073,1929250,"I beat what's currently available in this game in 6.4 hours: level 3 of the 3 maps, ending with Lunar Colony.  It was a challenge and absolutely packed with fun.  I have a lot of praise to give for the game, and a list of minor gripes.  Note that these are very minor gripes, and I still recommend the game overall.\n\nGripe number 1: Even though I'm using a gamepad with analog directional control, the movement seems to lock in to the 8 directions.  There are rotations between and I can fiddle back and forth to stay between, but if I'm not constantly moving the analog stick away from my intended direction, it doesn't follow the exact direction I'm using with the analog control.  I think the game would be better with this fixed, since I see no reason to lock into cardinal directions.  This is my main gripe with the game.\n\nGripe number 2: There are only 3 or 4 good upgrades on each weapon in the end of the game.  I want to get the cooldown reduction, damage, and crit on all my weapons.  If I get them, I clear everything with no problem.  If I happen to miss them on any of my weapons, the swarm becomes overwhelming and I can't beat the curve.\n\nGripe number 3: Each weapon is limited to 3 upgrades.  There is a ton of synergy between upgrades and I would have loved to focus on 1 weapon and get a ton of upgrades for it, which would limit the upgrades I can get for other weapons.  That would be very cool.  Unfortunately, you are forced to upgrade weapons you don't like instead of being able to pile onto 1 awesome weapon.  In combination with gripe number 2, all the weapons feel samey in the end if you want to win every battle.\n\nGripe number 4: Getting to the intended strafe angle wastes your movement significantly.  If I want to face a swarm and mow it down, I have to first get far away from them, then turn around and run toward them fairly significantly, such that it's very wasteful.  In the end-game, it's almost never a good idea to try that unless you have plenty of space.  It's better to get lucky with your enemy positions in the early game and run toward them.  This kind of defeats the coolness factor of learning to use the strafing system.  I would prefer if you could turn independently of your movement, even if that required some kind of upgrade.  If that happened, it would be also nice to have more than 1 decent weapon that takes advantage of your facing direction.  The laser is good but encourages never strafing, and the diagonal shot is just garbage in my experience.\n\nGripe number 5: Only the first mech that's unlocked by default is any good, and only the second pilot that's unlocked is good.  Choosing the other mechs than the one that has good handling or pilots than the one that increases attack speed is a sure way to lose in the highest difficulties.  It would be nice if later mechs and pilots that are unlocked had advantages, but they seem to be worse.  The mech that provides speed has such terrible handling that it's unusable, and the mech that adds max hp is useless because its other stats are worse and the max hp doesn't come back any faster if you're damaged.\n\nGripe number 6: The number of non-weapon upgrades you can get are artificially limited in such a way that you can break your whole run if you get the wrong ones.  If you don't get the healing upgrade, you are pretty much guaranteed to lose in the end-game.  Movement speed and handling are good together, but you're bound to take a hit or two whenever you get surrounded, and the healing upgrade is so significant that it's almost mandatory to succeed.  I tried a few runs without it and I only won without it once.\n\nGripe number 7: Leveling to max level is guaranteed on every full run, so you end up running out of ways to upgrade around the 10-to-12-minute mark, which leaves 8 to 9 minutes of no upgrading and just shooting and dodging.  It would be nice to be able to get further upgrades.  Maybe something like that is coming with meta-progression, but currently with the max level of 60, it feels a bit less fun after 12 minutes.\n\nGripe number 8: While I'm only half-way through the meta-progression after having beaten the last available mission, all the future meta-progression upgrades available are almost worthless.  I have the ones that boost damage, and the ones that boost handling and healing, but the rest do things that don't really matter, so I'm left wondering how I'll be able to increase my power for any harder missions.\n\nGripe number 9: The bosses at the end of each run are essentially jokes.  By the time I reached the third boss in each run (the last boss), I was so powerful that it would die in under 3 seconds if I just faced it and punched it.  I would have liked to see something like all the other enemies going away when the boss spawns and the boss being a serious threat on its own, at least in threat level 3 runs.  It'd be really cool to see the gameplay shift that would come with something like that.\n\nDespite all these minor gripes, the game kicks ass.  Here are some praises off the top of my head, and I'm not sure I can recall everything I liked:\n\n- I played on Linux, and the game ran perfectly, and my gamepad worked immediately.\n- There were absolutely 0 performance dips below 60 fps, which is my monitor's native refresh rate.  I'm using an Nvidia GTX 1080 Ti.\n- I encountered only 1 bug in the entire time I played, it was in the menu and caused a button to be disabled when it should be enabled, and it resolved itself with some simple re-navigation which enabled the buggy button.\n- The music and sounds are amazing, and I never felt the need to turn the sound off and replace it with a background video or my own music.\n- There is legitimate challenge which doesn't feel too frustrating.  There are definitely moments when it felt impossible to succeed just because of unlucky upgrade options, but buying some meta-progression and restarting the mission to try again a few times always resulted in a sense of progress and never just hopelessness.\n- The limitations of the current version of the game are clearly exhibited with \""Coming soon\"" buttons for future maps, mechs, and pilots, so I feel like even though I beat the game, I have more fun ahead.  I'm hoping the devs follow through because I'm excited to see any changes.\n- The price is fair for the game; just about the upper limit for a game I'd purchase individually without a bundle, considering I already have almost 1000 games and haven't played more than half of them.\n- This game is the best mech game I've ever played, and really makes me feel like I'm piloting a monstrous mech that has superior technology compared to vast armies of traditional units.\n- The enemies and graphics are very clear as to what will hurt you and what is good, while maintaining that unique feeling that comes from being in a huge mech.",1

137048576,1663220,"This game is wonderful, just as good as the first one, if not better in terms of writing. Having the foundation of the first game to use as a stepping stone really helped elevate the writing and expansion of returning characters. Here is my review after my first play-through of the game. \n\nI normally review games looking at both negatives (the bad) and the positives (the goods) and honestly I only have one negative about this game and it has nothing to do with game play. It is the title.\n\nI have seen many wonder if this is a dlc to the first game rather than a stand alone game due to how they titled it. The \""episode 2\"" part needs to go. Just Coffee Talk 2: Hibiscus & Butterfly\"" would have been better. The episode part just throws people off. \n\nAnd on the other end there's really so much positive to say about the game. The writing in this one is outstanding. The artwork, even though in the style of the first, looks just as wonderful if not better too! I love making drinks and guessing the drink combo's that the character orders. Also like the first game you input your name at the start of the game and the characters throughout the game refer to you by your name. A nice little touch to keep you immersed. You never see yourself in the game, it is always from your perspective. However this game had a few comments about our character that made it very interesting about who WE are. \n\nIn the second game you can influence the story more than the first game. By doing certain actions, like getting their drinks wrong or right, or forgetting to give them certain items,  you will have some different outcomes in how the story progresses for good or bad for some of the characters. You may even stop seeing customers if you mess up their drinks too often! Or if you give them the right drink or the right item you will see extra story content for some of the customers.  \n\nI had no crashes and the game supports widescreen. All you really need is your mouse to play. There is some light comedy, some heartfelt moments and some serious undertones to some of the characters' stories. A great game told through the stories of your customers as you, the ever present, caring barista listens on. \n\nA hug of appreciation for Mohammad Fahmi (may he rest in peace) and his entire team for forging ahead to bring the world of Coffee Talk to the fans again. It was well worth the wait and I think he would be so proud of the final game and the entire team.  I recommend both games, and honestly encourage everyone to start with playing the first one. For those who are returning to the world of Coffee Talk, enjoy your adventure! \u2615\n",1

137048737,2207490,"I'm not gonna lie - I'm pretty impressed. I wasn't expecting to be, since I generally do not enjoy 'Idle' games.  The developer of the original 'Factory Town' game (a VERY casual but enjoyable 3D city builder) has taken his game, and distilled many of the great aspects of the core game loop down to the most essential elements - which also removes the 3D building aspect - leaving only the 'town management' aspect of the game remaining.\n\nA town management simulator. It's enjoyable. It's minimalist. It hits all the right areas of the brain while playing, like a good 'Skinner Box' type game should. And since it's an 'Idle' game, you can play for awhile, log off to go have a life, then come back to additional progress that has been made while you were away.\n\nThankfully, the Dev does not (nor will he ever) use/abuse those mechanics to force players into micro-transactions like many other games do.  You get the whole game, immediately, with nothing else to purchase, ever.  A good game from a good Dev, with a good track record of quality and attention to the development process.\n\nEasily the best $5 (USD) I've spent on a game in quite awhile.",1

137101650,1537830,"In sum, Speedstorm is an extremely fun racing Kart game with a Disney theme on top of it that will be really interesting to see further developed and embracing more players when it becomes Free to Play (late 2023/early 2024). \nThe game has a really strong foundation in all aspects, so I'm looking forward for the upcoming new content updates, plus hope to see quick action on balance fixes to keep on top of player metas. Also wish to see players and gaming community concerns directly addressed when it pertains to attenuate parts of the monetization; the game can really flourish if this aspect is simplified and the focus is put on more avenues for the player to acquire even more unique visual cosmetics such as unique Karts and Character Skins.\n\n\n[b]  More intricate details about the game in general:[/b] \nThe vehicles handling, speed and the controller feel are great with a myriad of racers present all with different character specific skills plus the power-ups that you can get during the race that make every single race really frenetic and dynamic. Specially considering the good quantity of tracks and variations of them, which contain diverse paths that will be beneficial to each different racer type (Speedster, Trickster, Brawler, Defender).\nThe game also has a lot of Single-player content and two different Multiplayer Modes (Ranked with levels and Regulated where everyone is at the same level) great graphics that represent well all characters from the different IPs along with the themed tracks from each IP, plus a killer OST containing remixes from the most iconic tunes and movie songs that will definitely stay with you after the game session ends.\n\nThe only big caveat of the game as mentioned above, it's the way that you progress and acquire new characters which is tied to a gaccha system akin to other games that contains these type of monetization mechanics (e.g. Genshin Impact), turning into an over complicated experience to acquire characters and over extend the required time for acquisition versus having more ways to get them directly, plus bringing progression levels that not only tie to the Single layer related modes but also one Multiplayer Ranked mode. \nAlthough to note that all character currently feel competitive (some just requiring a slight change or nerf such as Mike and others a buff such as Beast) so in that sense it's not a major concern to aim for whichever character you like the most in terms of IP or their unique skill along with having a dedicated Multiplayer component (Regulated Multiplayer) in which everyone has the same character level so that players are not forced to worry and dive into the levelling system for online play (which is great fun since it always allows you to invite friends from all levels to join your race).\n\n[b]  The current character roster is the following:[/b] \n\u25a0 The classic Disney Trio: Mickey Mouse, Donald Duck, Goofy plus Steamboat Mickey (next season)\n\u25a0 Beauty and the Beast: Belle and Beast\n\u25a0 Hercules: Hercules and Meg\n\u25a0 The Jungle Book: Mowgli and Baloo\n\u25a0 Monsters, Inc: Sulley, Mike Wazowski, Randall, Celia Mae\n\u25a0 Mulan: Mulan and Shang\n\u25a0 Pirates of the Caribbean: Jack Sparrow and Elizabeth Swann\n\u25a0 Walt Disney World: Figment\n\u25a0 Possibly coming soon since the tracks were already teased: Toy Story and Lilo & Stitch \nNote: Currently if you didn't get a Founders Pack and this became F2P at this moment, you would pretty much have guaranteed Mickey, Donald and Goofy and get a decent quantity of Shards for others (due to the random nature you could get multiple new ones but it's not guaranteed).",1

Above all, what sets this game apart from others in the genre is the inclusion of hentai content, which can be unlocked through a special H-patch provided by the publisher. This content enhances the value of the game, adding some ecchi or hentai elements to the already engaging gameplay.\n\n[h1][b][2] Game Experience[/b][/h1]\n\nThe game is a visual treat with its amazing pixel art that immerses you in the eerie atmosphere of the abandoned hospital. The four heroines have unique characteristics and backstories that add depth and complexity to the overarching tale. As you progress through the game, you'll uncover clues, solve puzzles, and confront terrifying monsters that will make your heart race and your palms sweat.\n\nThe gameplay is intuitive and engaging, with a variety of challenges that keep you on your toes. You'll have to explore every nook and cranny of the hospital to find useful items and clues. The puzzles are cleverly designed and require both logic and creativity to solve. You'll also have to outrun and hide from monsters, and sometimes even confront them with whatever weapons you can find.\n\n[h1][b][3] Verdict [/b][/h1]\nIn conclusion, The Monstrous Horror Show is a well-crafted horror adventure game with a unique twist. It is a game that will keep you on edge from start to finish, and leave you with a sense of satisfaction and accomplishment when you finally escape the horrors of the abandoned hospital. The inclusion of adult content adds an extra layer of excitement and sensuality to the gameplay, making it a great choice for players looking for something a bit different.\n\n[h1][b]Side Note : [/b][/h1]\n[code]Looking for nice STEAM games?

The health is also so far from the chart that it feels impossible to tell who is in the lead until the chart starts flashing red.\n\nFrom the rhythm game sides of things, the only note speed options are in training mode for some reason. There is no way to change offset between different controllers to potentially account for different input delays, especially between wired and wireless controllers, which usually wouldn't be an issue for fighting games, but given there is the timing aspect of rhythm games giving you different strengths it feels like a strange oversight. The area that the chart is on is so small for the amount of notes you have that reading can get really hard that it feels like really dumb levels of memorisation. The organisation of charts for each map feels bizarre as it doesn't sort by difficulty for some reason. In fact there aren't really any way to sort charts to begin with.\n\nAlso there isn't a mode that lets you play the game like a normal rhythm game which feels like it leads to the charts ending up rather unmemorable.

The building system is alright, clearly designed for controller not keyboard and mouse, it lacks precision when building structures that a mouse affords (the objects ur building slide a bit as the camera influences the position of the mouse)\n\nSounds quality is decent, voice over can be a be cringe but im a cynical bastard xD\n\nCoop is kinda trash as you both use the same unit pool and resources, as well as the fact that once a troop is rallied to you, the other player cannot effect them with their banner calls. Meaning one player ends up having all the troops and the other player has to pick up random mobs that are mulling around.\n\nnot alot of the game is explained, whether thats designed or not i cant tell. all ill say is that dont immediately destroy \""portals\"", destroy all the buildings first otherwise youll screw yourself over, Really wish this was explained somewhere. i DO recommend the game, but $50 bucks AUD is a bit steep for the content, specially seeing as it comes with an ingame shop.",1

137105076,1679290,"I've been following this game since late 2021 and have seen  how much hard work and effort the devs put into this game. I'm not a huge strategy person but this game is an exception. This strategy game is set in a period where very few games touch and the amount of historical accuracy put into the game shows how much effort the devs put into it .Yes this game is kinda buggy and daunting at first  but I hope that everyone reading this gives the game as the devs are working really hard in polishing the game. \n\nTo the person reading this , give this game a try , if you find it to your liking that's awesome , if you don't like it that's completely fine :3",1

137106366,2281730,Thank you devs for having a functional bot mode with progression. Its so frustrating seeing so many studios releasing games without a feature that used to be in almost every multiplayer shooter. Had a ton of fun both solo and with friends. THE MOVEMENT IS INSANE. Everything is so fast; I was bunny-hopping around like Unreal or Quake. Please throw the devs a few bucks to keep the game going I am excited to see what the future holds. \u2665,1

137107375,1860510,"I give this a positive review with the extreme hope that this product is nowhere near finished. Too many times have developers pawned out unfinished games that end up being husks of what was promised. I don't know if this game will be any different, but this game really caught my attention.\n\nWhile the game itself feels like it requires much more work, the framework seems to be really sturdy, as in they have the foundation finished, all they need to do is focus on the smaller (but vital) details. The devs seem to be in touch with the community and it seems like there's actual hope for this to become a fleshed out title.\n\nWhile many failed attempts have been made to capture this genre, I sincerely believe that these developers have managed to figure it out. As long as they continue to work on the game, I believe this game can revolutionize the RTS/FPS hybrid genre.\n\nIn its current state, the game feels nowhere near finished but is still playable and has some fun moments. I only give this positive review to support the devs in their endeavor. If this just ends up being another quick money grab, I'll change my review at some point.",1
137107147,1860510,"its very complicated at first, but all the systems makes the preparation for war very rewarding. the fps gameplay is surprisingly good, the RTS mode is a bit clunky atm but it works fine for the most part. excited to see where the game goes.",1
137105337,2388170,"A card game with a mixture of the tycoon genre, where we will try on the role of a mafia boss. During the day we are engaged in legal restaurant business, and at night we are engaged in dark deeds - robberies, knocking out debts, intimidation, theft and everything that is inherent in villains.\n\nThe game looks beautiful, helped by the pixel style. I also hope that by the time the full version is released, the developers will fix the bugs - they, unfortunately, also exist.",1
